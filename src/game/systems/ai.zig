//! AI decision processor: gathers per-row perception/memory/affect/personality
//! signals, runs `arbitration.zig`'s utility scoring + sticky selection +
//! goal resolution (Slice 32) to pick one of 5 behaviors and a concrete goal,
//! then blends that goal with wander noise and local separation into a
//! `NavigationIntent`. Arbitration output is per-agent: perception's
//! `nearest_threat` is already faction-generic (any hostile can become a
//! pursue/flee target), and `AiConfig.focus_target`/`focus_entity` is an
//! explicit, opt-in, last-resort fallback gated on `gain_pursue > 0` — never
//! the primary signal.
//! Stateless (except work memory + per-system tuner); reads typed const slices for ai + movement prior positions,
//! pre-sizes NavigationIntent output ranges and uses staged parallelForWithOptions work.
//! Deterministic via explicit seed in config. Gather uses DataSystem dense-index lookup, so cost is bounded by live AI rows.
//! Separation queries the pipeline-owned `SpatialIndexSystem` (Slice 28) — the caller
//! builds it once per step from the unstaggered cognition halo and passes a
//! read-only `SpatialIndexView` in; this module no longer owns a private grid.
//! Think-set rows are a subset of that halo, so gather records `spatial_self_index`
//! (the thinker's row in the halo walk) and a `candidates` side table aligned 1:1
//! with spatial rows — the same mapping `perception.zig` uses, a deliberate
//! duplicate gather rather than a shared table. Single-list callers (null
//! `spatial_population_indices`) keep the equal-length path. See
//! `spatial_index.zig`'s module doc for the determinism-critical cell-scan
//! traversal order. The same shared index also backs arbitration's cohere
//! neighbor-mean gather (a second `queryNeighbors` call in the same
//! separation-stage job, filtered to friendly stance) — no second grid.
//! decideDir pure base; applySeparationAndNormalize shared (no logic dup). Serial fallback + threaded identical.
//! Arbitration itself (scoreBehaviors -> selectSticky -> resolveGoal per row) runs
//! inside the already-threaded `writeAiIntentsJob`/`writeAiSeparationJob` range jobs —
//! `updateSerial` calls the same job functions with a single full-range dispatch
//! (mirrors `computeAiSeparationsSerial`), so serial and threaded paths share one
//! code path by construction rather than two hand-duplicated ones.
//! Serial/main-only clamp for AI squares (math.clamp consistent with player, vel zero for AI decision rate).
//! Serial fallback, read-only workers, range aligned to ai_range_alignment_items, no hot alloc after init, direct SoA.
