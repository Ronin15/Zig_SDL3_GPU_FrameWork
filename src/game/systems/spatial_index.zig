//! Pipeline-owned shared spatial index (Slice 28). Builds one uniform grid per
//! fixed step from the unstaggered cognition-halo population and exposes a bounded,
//! radius-parameterized neighbor-query API. Replaces the private per-step grid
//! `AiSystem` used to build for separation and is the substrate future
//! perception queries (Slice 29) reuse instead of building a second grid.
//! Collision broadphase is intentionally NOT ported onto this index: it runs a
//! tuned sweep-and-prune order (`systems/collision.zig`) that is a different,
//! already-tuned algorithm, not a duplicate grid build.
//!
//! Scope: indexes the cognition-halo population passed via
//! `SpatialIndexConfig.scope_dense_indices` (tier + camera halo, **no** stagger),
//! not every movement body. Perception candidates walk the same list; think-set
//! observers/deciders are a stagger subset and map into these rows via
//! `spatial_self_index`. Indexing the full movement population would spend
//! build cost on entities nothing queries this step.
//!
//! Population-domain contract (also documented in `ai.zig`/`perception.zig`):
//! `build`/`buildSerial` walk `scope_dense_indices` (or all ai agents) resolving
//! `data.movementBodyDenseIndex(entity) orelse continue`, exactly mirroring the
//! halo candidate walks. This is a deliberate duplicate gather (not shared
//! code): index row `i` and each system's `candidates` row `i` refer to the
//! same agent. Think rows are a subset and must not be used as spatial
//! self-indices. Single-list callers (null halo, think == halo) keep the
//! equal-length path.
//!
//! Determinism-critical: floating-point neighbor-direction summation is not
//! associative, so callers that need bit-exact parity with a per-cell scan
//! depend on `queryNeighbors` visiting candidates in exactly cell_y-outer,
//! cell_x-inner, ascending-stored-index-within-cell order. This falls out of
//! `entries` being sorted with a cell-major (y then x), index-minor comparator
//! and ranges walked in that same cell order — do not silently change the scan
//! order (e.g. to x-outer) without re-checking every consumer's parity tests.
//!
//! Build shape: the per-entity gather (`spatialGatherJob`/`buildSerial`'s loop)
//! is a scattered, branchy dense-index lookup with a real skip, so it stays
//! scalar — the same shape as `AiSystem.gatherAiData` and the scope system's AI
//! gather job. Cell assignment is deliberately deferred to a separate dense
//! pass (`assignCellsDense`) over the merged, contiguous `rows` columns, run 4
//! rows at a time through `simd.floorToI4` with a scalar tail: gather into
//! packed SoA scratch, then vectorize the dense math, per
//! `docs/coding-standards.md`'s SIMD section.
//!
//! Populated-cell lookup: a row-major dense grid over a bounded,
//! camera-relative window (`DenseCellLookup`), direct-indexed rather than
//! hashed, so consecutive `cell.x` values at a fixed `cell.y` land on
//! consecutive flat indices. `queryNeighbors` exploits exactly that: it loads
//! 4 cells' `starts`/`ends` per batch with a plain contiguous
//! `simd.loadUint4` and tests occupancy with one `simd.equalUint4` compare
//! (see its doc comment). See `max_dense_window_side_cells`'s doc comment for
//! how the window is sized and the assumption it rests on.
