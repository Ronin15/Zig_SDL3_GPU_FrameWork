# Framework Implementation Slices — Archive

Completed, settled slices split out of
[framework-implementation-slices.md](framework-implementation-slices.md) to keep
the live roadmap focused on the open frontier. Every slice here is done and
verified (checklist/acceptance historical record). The live roadmap owns current
priorities, Scaling Gaps, Suggested Order, and open/residual slices (currently
**33** visual residual, **35**, **37–38**, **42**, **44**, **46**, **48**; **43** HW residual).

**Archived coverage:** Slices 0–7, 8, 9–17, 18–25E, 26–32, 34, 36, 39–41, 45, 47.

> Residual follow-ups from archived slices (e.g. optional `mergeDrawList`
> micro-opt, Slice 30 deferred `memory_expired` event, Slice 32's cohere
> `.group` upgrade and optional `behavior_changed` event, interest-marker
> consumers beyond investigate) live as open work in the live roadmap's
> **Scaling Gaps**, **Next Priority Tracks**, or the consuming open slice
> (42) — not as incomplete archive checklists. The Slice 23A

## Slice 0: Runtime Diagnostics Policy

Goal: use Zig's compile-time `std.log` filtering so debug builds can show useful
diagnostics while release builds stay quiet except for warnings and errors.

Current foundation:

- [x] Add `-Dlog-level=auto|err|warn|info|debug`.
- [x] Default `auto` to `debug` for Debug and `warn` for release modes.
- [x] Apply the policy through root `std_options` for the app, tests, and GPU smoke executable.
- [x] Add project log scopes for app, assets, core, game, render, platform, and debug overlay.
- [x] Use scoped logs for current render, platform, and debug-overlay diagnostics.
- [x] Keep routine startup facts such as the SDL_GPU driver at debug level.
- [x] Keep warnings for recovered degraded behavior and errors for real failure context.
- [x] Keep shader/config helper functions log-free where tests use pure logic.

Checklist:

- [x] Audit app, assets, game, core, render, and platform code for actionable diagnostics.
- [x] Add scoped logs only where they report startup facts, recovered degraded behavior, or real failure context.
- [x] Keep normal frame/update/render hot paths free of per-frame string formatting.
- [x] Keep pure helpers and validation helpers log-free unless they are runtime wrappers.
- [x] Keep release builds quiet by default while preserving warnings and errors.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] `zig build test` compiles the test root with the shared log policy.
- [x] `zig build check` compiles the app, GPU smoke, and benchmark executables.
- [x] `zig build check --release=safe` verifies the release log-level default.
- [x] Project-wide diagnostic audit confirms no meaningful subsystem still uses default-scope logging or noisy warning/error severity.

## Slice 1: Input Routing

Goal: let modal UI, gameplay, and debug commands control which actions receive
input without broad special cases in `Engine`.

Current foundation:

- [x] `InputState` tracks held gameplay actions.
- [x] `FrameCommands` tracks one-frame commands.
- [x] `input_router.zig` defines context-oriented routing contracts.
- [x] `StatePolicy` carries the active named-action routing policy.
- [x] `StatePolicy` explicitly marks modal and opaque states that block held
      gameplay input in the active event path.
- [x] Pause and modal routing intentionally release held gameplay movement; keys
      pressed while gameplay is blocked are not synthesized on resume.
- [x] Engine logs the low-frequency gameplay-routing block transition at app
      debug scope when held movement is released.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a routing policy field to the active state policy or derive it from the
      active state stack entry.
- [x] Route SDL key events through `InputRoutingPolicy` before mutating
      `InputState` or `FrameCommands`.
- [x] Keep debug commands available unless explicitly disabled.
- [x] Ensure modal overlays can block gameplay held input.
- [x] Ensure pass-through overlays do not tunnel gameplay input through modal or
      opaque blockers in the active event path.
- [x] Release held gameplay movement when a modal policy starts blocking gameplay.
- [x] Add tests for gameplay-only, modal UI, pass-through overlay, and debug
      command behavior.
- [x] Update README input guidance after behavior is wired.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] A gameplay state still receives WASD movement by default.
- [x] A modal state can prevent gameplay movement from being latched underneath.
- [x] A pass-through overlay above a modal state still leaves gameplay movement
      blocked.
- [x] F2 debug overlay toggle still works while gameplay is active.
- [x] `zig build test` covers routing behavior without opening a window.

## Slice 2: Logical Resolution And Viewport Policy

Goal: make logical game coordinates deliberate before real UI, resizing, or
high-DPI behavior depends on them.

Current foundation:

- `AppConfig` owns a `ResolutionPolicy` plus resizable and high-pixel-density
  window defaults.
- `resolution.zig` defines logical size, scale mode, viewport math,
  presentation state, and pure coordinate conversion helpers.
- Renderer computes presentation from SDL_GPU swapchain drawable size and SDL
  window size on each submitted frame.
- World and logical drawing is transformed through the logical presentation into
  drawable pixels, then clipped to the logical viewport; drawable overlays use
  raw swapchain pixels.
- Integer-fit windows request a logical-size minimum client area so user
  resizing should not normally crop below 1x scale.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a `ResolutionPolicy` to `AppConfig`.
- [x] Compute the current `Viewport` when swapchain/window size changes.
- [x] Apply the viewport through SDL_GPU render pass or draw transform as
      appropriate for SDL_GPU.
- [x] Keep world/game drawing in logical coordinates.
- [x] Decide whether debug overlay is logical-space or screen-space and document it.
- [x] Add tests for fit, integer-fit, stretch, small windows, and invalid sizes.
- [x] Update README with resize/logical-resolution behavior.
- [x] Prevent normal sub-logical integer-fit resizing with SDL window minimum size.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Existing demo renders correctly at the default 1280x720 logical size.
- [x] Resizable windows preserve the configured scale policy.
- [x] Letterbox offsets are centered and stable.
- [x] Hidden/minimized windows still skip rendering and use fallback pacing;
      visible no-swapchain frames enter render-blocked gameplay pause before
      the next update.
- [x] `zig build test`, `zig build check`, `zig build verify`, and
      `zig build gpu-smoke` cover unit, compile, shader, and one-frame GPU smoke
      validation. Manual `zig build dev` resize/pause smoke confirmed Retina
      1280x720 -> 2560x1440 and resized 1800x1130 -> 3600x2260 fit presentation.

## Slice 3: Render Resource Layer

Goal: replace long-lived raw texture indices with a resource layer that can grow
into caching, reload, and ownership tracking.

Current foundation:

- Renderer owns GPU textures in a generational slot table.
- Public renderer APIs use `TextureId` instead of long-lived raw texture indices.
- `resources.zig` defines generational `TextureId` and resource descriptors.

Architecture notes:

- Future atlas and tile rendering should reuse one atlas `TextureId` with
  per-sprite or per-tile source rectangles. Slice 3 intentionally stops at
  stable texture identity, descriptor lookup, and stale-ID rejection; it does not
  add atlas metadata, tilemap storage, or tile renderer batching.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a slot table for textures with generation, alive state, and descriptor.
- [x] Add `TextureId` creation, validation, lookup, and destruction helpers.
- [x] Keep draw submission lookup array-backed and allocation-free.
- [x] Preserve the white texture as an internal renderer resource.
- [x] Keep renderer texture creation centered on decoded pixel uploads through
      `createTextureFromPixels` and `replaceTextureFromPixels`.
- [x] Add tests for stale IDs, destroyed IDs, invalid generation, and descriptor
      validation.
- [x] Add a focused compatibility note for the `TextureHandle` to `TextureId`
      rename.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Destroyed or stale texture IDs are skipped or rejected deterministically.
- [x] Existing demo and debug text still render.
- [x] Texture upload validation still rejects bad dimensions, pitch, and buffer
      lengths before GPU work.
- [x] No hash map lookup is introduced into per-sprite draw submission.

## Slice 4: Asset Cache

Goal: make runtime asset ownership explicit enough for real projects without
building a broad content pipeline too early.

Current foundation:

- `AssetStore` resolves safe relative paths from repo root or executable-relative
  install location.
- `AssetStore` resolves and decodes PNGs into transient CPU `LoadedImage` data.
- `AssetCache` maps validated relative PNG paths to retained renderer
  `TextureId` values by decoding through assets and asking render to upload
  already-decoded pixels.
- `Engine` owns the cache. Slice 17 later moved gameplay-facing render lookup
  to stable `RuntimeAssets` IDs exposed through `RenderContext`.
- `assets/test/cache_probe.png` provides a tiny installed PNG fixture for cache
  and asset-root checks.

Render-data boundary:

- Entity creation and world loading should bind stable sprite or atlas-region
  IDs before render-time. `DataSystem` render data should store stable asset
  references plus source intent such as tint, typed render-depth intent, and
  coordinate-space intent, not live renderer handles or raw layer numbers.
- State-owned render-prep code reads immutable `DataSystem` slices, resolves
  stable IDs through `RuntimeAssets`, and submits commands to `Renderer` only
  after an explicit ordered render-prep phase. The renderer should not look up
  gameplay entities, world data, asset paths, or texture assignments.
- Atlas and tile work should build on the same boundary: assets decode source
  images, atlas code packs CPU pixels, render uploads the final atlas texture,
  entities or tile cells reference atlas regions, and render prep converts those
  IDs into ordered commands with explicit `RenderOrder`.

Checklist:

- [x] Add an asset/resource cache module that maps stable asset paths to
      renderer resource IDs.
- [x] Keep path validation in `AssetStore`; do not duplicate traversal checks.
- [x] Decide cache ownership: app-level service owned by `Engine` is the default.
- [x] Add explicit load/unload or retain/release policy before adding hot reload.
- [x] Keep synchronous load first; defer async/staged loading until needed.
- [x] Add tests for duplicate path reuse, unload behavior, and invalid paths.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Loading the same PNG twice can reuse the existing texture.
- [x] Asset paths remain relative and traversal-safe.
- [x] Installed-binary asset lookup still works with `-Dasset-root`.

## Slice 5: Text And Font Service

Goal: move from FPS-only SDL_ttf usage to asset-backed text rendering suitable
for menus, buttons, and UI.

Current foundation:

- SDL3_ttf is a core dependency.
- `TextService` owns SDL3_ttf lifecycle, asset-backed font loading, and cached
  renderer text textures.
- `FpsCounter` consumes the text service instead of probing system fonts or
  owning raw SDL_ttf resources.
- `assets/fonts/NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf` is the bundled default text font.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a centralized text/font service that owns `TTF_Init` and `TTF_Quit`.
- [x] Load fonts from `assets/fonts/...` through `AssetStore`.
- [x] Add `FontId` allocation and validation using generational IDs.
- [x] Render text into cached renderer textures.
- [x] Define cache invalidation for text string, font, color, wrap width, and
      layout options.
- [x] Move `FpsCounter` to consume the text service.
- [x] Add at least one bundled font or document the asset requirement clearly.
- [x] Add tests for descriptor validation and cache keys where possible.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] F2 overlay still renders yellow FPS text.
- [x] No system font path probing remains in normal text flow.
- [x] Text texture lifetime is centralized and cleaned up by the owning service.

## Slice 6: Renderer Composition

Goal: split renderer responsibilities so sprites, UI, shapes, tilemaps, and
future effects do not all require editing one monolithic renderer path.

Implemented foundation:

- `Renderer` owns frame coordination, public draw APIs, texture IDs, swapchain
  acquisition, render-pass encoding, and command submission.
- Explicit render-prep phases own transient ordering across world, UI, effect,
  and debug producers.
- `SpriteBatch` owns strict ordered-stream validation, vertex expansion, and
  draw-group construction.
- `src/render/gpu/` owns SDL_GPU device/window setup helpers, pipeline creation,
  upload buffers, and texture upload helpers.
- Build now has a shader-program table for the existing sprite shader pair.

Architecture notes:

- Prefer landing Slice 3 resource IDs before physically splitting
  `renderer.zig`, so texture ownership does not migrate across several files at
  the same time as the handle model changes.
- The first split uses `src/render/gpu/` for SDL_GPU device/window setup,
  shader/pipeline creation, buffers, and texture upload, with ordered-stream
  validation and vertex expansion in `sprite_batch.zig`.
- Keep `Renderer` as the game-facing facade and frame coordinator; the split
  should hide GPU details behind narrower render-owned modules, not expose more
  SDL_GPU surface area to game states.

Checklist:

- [x] Keep `Renderer` as the device/frame coordinator.
- [x] Move sprite batching internals behind a `SpriteBatch` or equivalent module.
- [x] If `renderer.zig` remains too broad after resource IDs land, split GPU
      setup, pipeline, buffer, and texture helpers under `src/render/gpu/`.
- [x] Introduce static material/pipeline records for the current sprite pipeline.
- [x] Keep draw record ordering stable by `RenderOrder` and submission order.
- [x] Preserve explicit `Renderer.submitOrdered*` calls for already ordered
      renderer-owned paths and route unordered producers through explicit
      render-prep ordering.
- [x] Add tests for batch grouping, invalid texture skipping, and ordering.
- [x] Re-run `gpu-smoke` when display access is available.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Existing demo output is unchanged.
- [x] New batcher owns sprite-specific vertex construction.
- [x] Renderer frame lifecycle still handles `.submitted` and
      `.skipped_no_swapchain` correctly.
- [x] Adding a second batcher later would not require rewriting device setup.

## Slice 7: Preallocated Thread System And Parallel Render Prep

Goal: add a deterministic, pre-spawned worker system that lets each engine
system use all active workers for CPU work, then finish before the next system
or render phase starts.

Current foundation:

- `Engine` owns app coordination and state-stack update/render flow.
- `main.zig` owns the outer loop and calls `Engine` phase methods; `Engine`
  delegates state callbacks through `StateStack` policy dispatch.
- `TimeLoop` already enforces fixed-step gameplay updates.
- Renderer command submission is currently serial and owns SDL_GPU command
  buffers, swapchain acquisition, vertex upload, and submit.
- Current sprite and rectangle drawing flows through `SpriteBatch`, with stable
  sprite IDs resolved by `RuntimeAssets` before draw submission.
- Zig 0.16 provides `std.Thread.spawn`, atomics, and `std.Io` blocking
  primitives; this checkout does not rely on a std thread-pool abstraction.

Architecture notes:

- This is a synchronous frame-batch system, not a general async job scheduler.
  It is for systems that need CPU work completed before the frame can continue.
- There is one active batch at a time. A batch exposes an atomic range queue:
  participants claim the next `ParallelRange` with an atomic cursor.
- Worker threads park when idle. Do not add spin-wait configuration unless
  measurement proves condition-variable wake latency is the bottleneck.
- `max_worker_threads` counts only pre-spawned worker threads. The
  main/render thread may also process ranges, so the default `cpu_count - 1`
  worker threads uses all normal CPU participants without oversubscription.
- Long-lived async work such as asset streaming or file IO should use a
  separate service later instead of sharing this frame-bounded barrier path.

Thread-system design:

- [x] Add `src/app/thread_system.zig` with `ThreadSystem`,
      `ThreadSystemConfig`, `WorkerId`, `ParallelRange`, `BatchStats`, and a
      deterministic `parallelFor` API.
- [x] Own `ThreadSystem` from `Engine`; initialize it after SDL/app config is
      known and deinitialize it before allocator teardown.
- [x] Pre-spawn up to `max_worker_threads` worker threads at init with
      `std.Thread.spawn`.
      Never create or destroy OS threads during gameplay frames.
- [x] Default worker thread count to one fewer than
      `std.Thread.getCpuCount()` when possible, reserving the main/render thread
      as an additional batch participant; allow config override for worker
      thread count, stack size, and items per claimed range
      (`items_per_range`).
- [x] Use preallocated worker records, one synchronous batch descriptor, and an
      atomic range cursor. No frame-batch submission may allocate after
      initialization.
- [x] Use atomics for hot range claiming and range stats; use `std.Io.Mutex` and
      `std.Io.Condition` only for batch publication, worker parking, completion,
      and shutdown paths where blocking is expected.
- [x] Let the main thread participate in submitted batches while waiting so it
      does useful work instead of only acting as a coordinator.
- [x] Dynamically scale active workers only at batch boundaries based on prior
      batch cost, item count, main-thread wait time, and worker utilization.
      Static item-count floors do not gate production worker participation;
      timing and structural range feasibility decide whether work stays inline.
- [x] Stop accepting work during shutdown, wake parked workers, join every
      pre-spawned thread, and assert that no frame batch is still outstanding.

Engine/system integration:

- [x] Add an update/render-prep context that exposes `thread_system` to states
      or future systems without moving timing policy out of `main.zig`.
- [x] Preserve the runtime flow where `main.zig` calls `Engine` phase methods
      and `Engine` invokes eligible state callbacks through `StateStack`.
- [x] Keep systems ordered: each system may use the whole worker set, but all
      of its jobs must complete before the next system starts.
- [x] Allow worker jobs to read immutable snapshots and write only disjoint
      output ranges.
- [x] Add explicit per-worker scratch slot indexing keyed by `WorkerId` before
      systems need temporary output buffers.
- [x] Keep `StateTransitions`, state-stack mutation, SDL events, SDL window
      calls, and renderer ownership on the main thread.
- [x] Record batch stats in a lightweight struct that debug overlay or logs can
      consume later without adding hot-path string formatting.

Parallel render-prep design:

- [x] Keep SDL_GPU command-buffer acquisition, swapchain acquisition, GPU
      upload, render-pass encoding, and submit on the main/render thread for
      the first implementation.
- [x] Split CPU render prep into explicit phases: producers own intentional
      transient ordering, then `SpriteBatch` consumes the ordered stream for
      texture validation, sprite-to-vertex expansion, and draw-group
      construction. The renderer does not keep compatibility fallback sorting
      that hides producer-order bugs.
- [x] Keep the render prep tuner and stats owned by `SpriteBatch`/`Renderer`
      instead of relying on the generic `ThreadSystem` fallback tuner.
- [x] Snapshot texture/resource metadata needed by workers before dispatch so
      worker jobs never observe renderer arrays while they are being mutated.
- [x] Merge worker outputs on the main thread in command-stream order, then
      upload the final vertex buffer and submit one GPU command buffer.
- [x] Preserve the inline path and let the adaptive tuner choose it for work
      that does not benefit from worker dispatch.
- [x] Add a non-interactive `render-prep` benchmark group that reports draw
      commands, valid sprites, skipped invalid resources, vertex count, draw
      groups, worker use, range size, and adaptive tuning state.
      Interpret `thread-fixed-*` rows as forced scheduler/range controls and
      `thread-adaptive-*` rows as the production-style measured scheduling
      signal; cheap sprite/rect prep should stay inline until the adaptive
      tuner proves worker participation wins.
- [x] Defer threaded SDL_GPU command buffers until profiling proves main-thread
      command encoding is the bottleneck. If added later, command buffers must
      be acquired, used, and submitted on the same worker thread; swapchain
      acquisition must remain on the window thread.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] `parallelFor` covers every item exactly once and never writes outside the
      requested range.
- [x] Batch execution performs no allocations after init/reserve; enforce this
      with a failing allocator in tests.
- [x] System barriers are deterministic: later systems always see completed
      output from earlier systems.
- [x] Shutdown wakes and joins parked workers without leaking or deadlocking.
- [x] Worker idle policy parks on a condition variable; no spin loop or unused
      spin configuration remains in the config.
- [x] Serial and parallel render prep produce identical vertex order, draw
      group order, render ordering, and invalid-texture skipping for the same
      command input.
- [x] Existing visible rendering remains swapchain/vsync paced, hidden/minimized
      fallback pacing remains unchanged, and visible no-swapchain results block
      gameplay before the next update.
- [x] `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and `zig build verify` pass before
      the slice is considered complete.

Slice 7 is complete for the current sprite/rect renderer path. It has a
pre-spawned app-owned `ThreadSystem`, explicit update/render contexts,
synchronous `parallelFor`, adaptive per-batch worker-thread participation,
per-worker scratch slot indexing, and render-owned parallel CPU sprite prep.
State-owned render prep owns draw-record ordering by `RenderOrder`, including
world z, stack-aware UI depth, effects, and debug records. `SpriteBatch`
consumes only an already ordered stream, snapshots texture metadata on the main
thread, expands prepared sprites into disjoint vertex spans through the thread
system, builds draw groups deterministically on the main thread, and leaves
SDL_GPU command-buffer work on the render thread. Future tile rendering, UI widgets,
material registries, lighting/fire effects, or threaded GPU command buffers
remain separate slices that must preserve this queue-first ordering contract
unless they replace it with an explicitly measured render-owned ordering phase.

## Slice 9: Platform-Neutral SIMD Helper Layer

Goal: provide a small SIMD helper layer with clear project names so movement,
particles, and other hot data processors can use vectors without exposing
platform-specific intrinsic names throughout gameplay code.

Current foundation:

- `src/core/math.zig` contains small math primitives.
- `ThreadSystem.parallelFor` already divides work into contiguous ranges.
- Future movement and particle processors are expected to operate on SoA slices.
- The v1 helper uses Zig `@Vector` as the project abstraction; LLVM may lower the
  resulting vector operations to SSE-family or NEON instructions for suitable
  targets and optimize modes, but this slice does not hand-write target-specific
  intrinsics.

Checklist:

- [x] Add `src/core/simd.zig` with friendly vector aliases such as `Float4`,
      `Int4`, and `Mask4`.
- [x] Prefer portable Zig vector types first, hiding target-specific intrinsic
      details behind the helper API.
- [x] Add load, store, splat, add, subtract, multiply, divide, min, max,
      compare, select, and clamp helpers needed by movement and particle loops.
- [x] Add scalar-tail helpers for item counts that are not a multiple of the
      vector lane count.
- [x] Keep the helper free of game-specific entity, particle, SDL, renderer, or
      thread-system dependencies.
- [x] Document when scalar code should be preferred for tiny batches or clarity.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] SIMD helper tests prove lane order is stable.
- [x] SIMD and scalar implementations produce identical results for representative
      float and integer operations.
- [x] Tail handling covers empty, partial, exact-lane, and multi-lane inputs.
- [x] `zig build test` passes on targets where the helper is expected to compile.

## Slice 10: DataSystem And SoA Composition Foundation

Goal: introduce `DataSystem` as the state-owned persistent gameplay data
container and save/load streaming boundary, with dense SoA storage designed for
fast systems, threading, and SIMD.

Current foundation:

- `StateStack` owns active state lifetimes.
- `UpdateContext` exposes `ThreadSystem` to states.
- `GameDemoState` owns a `DataSystem` for state-local persistent game-world data.
- `Player` remains a player-specific behavior facade, backed by entity data in
  `DataSystem`.

Architecture notes:

- `DataSystem` is intentionally the unique name for the persistent data
  container.
- `DataSystem` persists for the lifetime of the owning gameplay state, not as a
  global app singleton.
- Systems are processors that borrow or view `DataSystem`; they do not own
  persistent gameplay data.
- Save/load should stream `DataSystem`, not `Engine`, `StateStack`, renderer,
  thread system, input, or transient frame state.
- Composition comes from meaningful data membership in typed stores, not from a
  free-form component soup where arbitrary behavior combinations are implied.
- Per-entity component masks are the membership/query layer. Hot system data is
  still exposed through aligned scalar SoA slices, not joined dynamically in the
  update or render loop.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a game data module with `DataSystem` and an entity ID/generation
      registry.
- [x] Add dense scalar-column SoA stores for initial persistent gameplay data
      such as movement bodies and renderable primitive visual intent.
- [x] Use stable handles or dense indices so stores can remain compact while
      rejecting stale IDs.
- [x] Keep SDL handles, GPU handles, input frame state, renderer state,
      `ThreadSystem`, transient events, and scratch buffers outside `DataSystem`.
- [x] Store persistent asset references as stable IDs or relative paths, not
      live renderer texture handles.
- [x] Add explicit init/deinit and clear/reset behavior for state lifecycle and
      save/load preparation.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Entity IDs reject stale generations after removal and reuse.
- [x] Dense SoA stores keep arrays length-aligned and compact after add/remove.
- [x] Movement-body columns can be loaded directly with `src/core/simd.zig`
      helpers and handle vector ranges plus scalar tails.
- [x] Component masks track entity membership for future system queries without
      replacing the SIMD-ready SoA storage.
- [x] `DataSystem` can be initialized and deinitialized without leaks.
- [x] Tests cover which data belongs inside `DataSystem` versus transient runtime
      services that must stay outside it.

Slice 10 landed as a state-owned data foundation. Update systems mutate
`DataSystem` slices, render systems read immutable slices and submit through
`Renderer`, and live engine/runtime services stay outside persistent data. The
movement-body store is SIMD-ready scalar SoA storage; threaded/SIMD processors
remain Slice 11 work.

## Slice 11: SIMD-Aware Data Processor Systems

Goal: add high-performance systems that process `DataSystem` slices with the
thread system and SIMD helpers while preserving deterministic fixed-step update
behavior.

Current foundation:

- `ThreadSystem.parallelFor` runs synchronous range batches and returns only
  after all selected workers finish.
- `ThreadSystem.parallelForWithOptions` can align ranges to hot-column cache
  boundaries and cap selected worker threads for a specific processor.
- `UpdateContext` passes `thread_system` into states.
- `DataSystem` provides persistent 64-byte-aligned movement SoA slices for
  systems to process.
- `src/core/simd.zig` provides portable vector helpers.
- `MovementSystem` integrates explicit movement-body SoA slices through a serial
  path or `ThreadSystem.parallelForWithOptions`.
- `ParticleSystem` owns a state-local fixed-capacity transient SoA pool and
  updates particle rows through a serial path or
  `ThreadSystem.parallelForWithOptions`.
- `GameDemoState` spawns a few colored moving square entities so the processor has
  visible non-player runtime coverage.
- `GameDemoState` emits and renders transient particle rectangles through its state
  update/render functions.

Performance notes:

- Hot processors should iterate SoA columns directly, not per-entity AoS structs
  or dynamically joined component records.
- `ThreadSystem` integration is required for this slice. Keep a serial path for
  tests, explicit fallback behavior, and deterministic comparisons, but the
  processor API and tests must prove that systems can split `DataSystem` slices through
  `ThreadSystem.parallelFor`.
- Treat adaptive work tuning as a measured batch-profile policy, not a separate
  worker-count heuristic. The tuner starts inline, probes threaded profiles only
  when measured batch time justifies it, then searches aligned range sizes
  around the best measured threaded profile before settling. Benchmark output
  should keep reporting worker count, range size, main-thread wait time, and
  worker utilization so regressions are visible.
- Treat cache-line behavior as part of the processor contract. SoA columns used
  by SIMD processors should have an explicit alignment policy before relying on
  wider loads or target-specific vector behavior.
- Padding to 64-byte cache lines should be applied deliberately to thread-shared
  records, worker scratch, counters, queues, and other concurrently written
  coordination data where false sharing is a real risk.
- Do not pad the cold entity slot metadata by default. Entity slots hold
  generation, component masks, free-list state, and dense store indices; they
  should stay out of hot movement/render processor loops unless profiling proves
  otherwise.
- Worker ranges should be chosen so two workers do not write the same cache line
  of a hot SoA column during normal fixed-step processing.

System shape:

- `MovementSystem` reads and writes explicit movement-body SoA slices, keeps a
  simple serial path for tests and deterministic comparisons, and uses
  timing-adaptive threaded SIMD ranges for eligible batches.
- `MovementSystem` must not create, destroy, add, or remove entities/components
  inside worker ranges. Structural changes from future processors should flow
  through the state-owned simulation frame and `DataSystem` batch commit path.
- `ParticleSystem` is a state-owned transient effect system rather than a
  `DataSystem` entity processor. It keeps emission and expired row swap-removal
  on the main thread, while worker ranges only mutate assigned particle rows.
- These implementations prove the threaded/SIMD system contract before
  broadening into AI, collision, pathfinding, or render-prep processors.

Checklist:

- [x] Define ECS systems as data processors that accept typed `DataSystem`
      slices/views, `ThreadSystem`, and fixed-step delta time; document
      `ParticleSystem` as the state-owned transient effect exception.
- [x] Add a movement processor that splits dense SoA slices through
      `parallelFor`.
- [x] Add particle processors that split dense SoA slices through `parallelFor`.
- [x] Wire `MovementSystem` through `ThreadSystem.parallelFor` with a serial path
      for deterministic tests and explicit comparisons.
- [x] Use SIMD inside each worker range and scalar-tail code for remainder
      elements.
- [x] Add an explicit alignment strategy for hot SoA columns before introducing
      wider or target-specific vector loads.
- [x] Audit thread-shared processor data for false sharing and add 64-byte
      padding only where concurrent writes justify it.
- [x] Ensure worker jobs write only to assigned disjoint ranges.
- [x] Ensure worker ranges avoid sharing writable cache lines in hot SoA columns.
- [x] Keep state transitions, entity creation/removal, SDL calls, GPU calls,
      asset loading, and save/load streaming on the main thread.
- [x] Keep particle expired-row removal on the main thread after the worker
      batch completes. Future systems that produce per-worker output buffers
      will need an explicit deterministic merge step.
- [x] Keep normal 60Hz update paths allocation-free after initialization.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Scalar and SIMD movement results match for representative data sets.
- [x] Serial and threaded processor results match for the same initial
      `DataSystem`.
- [x] The movement processor has test coverage for the serial path and the
      `ThreadSystem.parallelFor` path.
- [x] Worker jobs do not write outside their assigned `ParallelRange`.
- [x] Hot SoA columns used by SIMD processors have documented alignment behavior.
- [x] Thread-shared processor records that are concurrently written are either
      disjoint by design or padded/aligned to avoid false sharing.
- [x] Update processors perform no allocations during steady-state simulation.
- [x] Fixed-step update order remains deterministic: later systems always see
      completed output from earlier systems.

Movement and particle passes landed: the demo maps player input to movement
velocity, exposes a movement-body slice to `MovementSystem`, applies player-only
bounds clamping, emits a small particle trail, updates particles, and renders
transient particle rectangles. A few colored moving squares remain as non-player
movement processor coverage. Simulation contracts, collision, and the first AI
intent processor are covered by Slices 12-14. Pathfinding and broader rule
processing remain future systems that should build on the same typed-output
contracts.

## Slice 12: Simulation Contracts And Deferred Structural Changes

Goal: define deterministic, efficient simulation phase contracts before broad
gameplay systems start creating entities, emitting events, or requesting
structural changes from worker jobs.

Implemented foundation:

- `main.zig` -> `Engine` -> `StateStack` is the existing runtime dispatch path
  for events, fixed updates, and rendering.
- `StateTransitions` already queues state-stack changes until dispatch is safe.
- `DataSystem` owns persistent state-local gameplay data and excludes transient
  services.
- `ThreadSystem` runs synchronous range batches that complete before the next
  system consumes their output.
- `ParallelRange.index` gives inline and threaded jobs stable range-order
  identity independent of worker scheduling.
- `SimulationFrame` is state-owned transient per-step data with typed event,
  intent, and deferred structural command streams.
- `RangeOutputStream(T)` implements count/prefix/write output collection and
  deterministic range-index merge.
- `DataSystem.applyStructuralCommands` applies deferred entity/component changes
  at explicit main-thread commit points.
- `SimulationFrame.applyStructuralCommandsWithExtraEvents` commits deferred
  structural commands through `DataSystem`'s single planning path: event-stream
  capacity stays with `SimulationFrame`, while `DataSystem` validates commands
  and reserves persistent component storage capacity before mutation.
- `GameDemoState` owns a `SimulationFrame`, clears it each fixed step, runs
  processor phases, and applies deferred structural commands before the step
  finishes.
- `MovementSystem` now consumes explicit movement-body slices rather than broad
  structural `DataSystem` access.

Architecture notes:

- Structural entity/component changes, state transitions, SDL/GPU calls, asset
  loading, save/load streaming, and renderer ownership must remain behind an
  explicit main-thread or deferred boundary.
- Determinism, performance, and efficiency are one contract: output order must
  come from stable input/range order, not worker timing or worker IDs; high-volume
  outputs must use typed range-owned buffers instead of global per-command append,
  callback chains, or hot-path hash maps; warmed paths must avoid allocation.
- Threaded output collection should use a count/prefix/write pipeline:
  count outputs per range, prefix offsets on the main thread, write contiguous
  output by range, merge by range index, then consume the typed batch.
- Structural mutation remains behind `DataSystem` batch commit boundaries.
  Event and intent streams use the same typed range-output model, but remain
  transient simulation data rather than persistent `DataSystem` state.
- Designs should make fixed-step processor order, input order, output owner,
  merge order, allocation policy, conflict resolution, and structural apply
  points explicit before adding systems that can interact emergently.

Checklist:

- [x] Define the fixed-step simulation phase order for gameplay processors,
      transient events, deferred structural commands, and save/load hooks.
- [x] Add stable `ParallelRange.index` support so output order can be tied to
      deterministic range order rather than worker scheduling.
- [x] Add a state-owned simulation frame with typed event, intent, and deferred
      structural command streams.
- [x] Add range-owned output collection for high-volume streams using
      count/prefix/write and deterministic range-index merge.
- [x] Add `DataSystem` batch commit boundaries for deferred structural changes;
      do not expose per-command structural mutation as the simulation output API.
- [x] Refactor `MovementSystem` so the processor path receives typed slices
      rather than broad structural `DataSystem` access.
- [x] Add tests that worker-produced outputs merge in stable order.
- [x] Refactor typed processor APIs so hot processor paths avoid broad
      structural `DataSystem` access.
- [x] Document what belongs in persistent `DataSystem` state versus transient
      per-frame simulation data.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Deferred entity/component changes apply only after the producing processor
      completes.
- [x] Replaying the same initial data and inputs produces the same event,
      command, and processor output order, independent of worker timing.
- [x] High-volume output paths use preallocated typed arrays, slices, range-owned
      buffers, and deterministic batch commit instead of global per-command
      atomics, broad event buses, or hot-path hash-map dispatch.
- [x] Save/load boundaries exclude transient frame events, scratch buffers,
      renderer resources, app services, and thread-system state.

## Slice 13: Spatial Queries And Collision Contacts

Goal: add data-oriented spatial query and collision contact foundations that can
feed gameplay response systems without turning hot loops into per-entity object
dispatch.

Current foundation:

- `DataSystem` has entity IDs, component masks, movement bodies, primitive
  visual intent, dedicated collision bounds, and aligned movement SoA columns.
- `MovementSystem` updates positions deterministically before later processors
  read them.
- Slice 12 provides the event/deferred-command boundary needed for collision
  outcomes that create, remove, or change entities.

Architecture notes:

- `CollisionSystem` owns warmed transient AABB proxy scratch, not persistent
  gameplay data.
- The first broadphase is sweep-and-prune over entities with both movement bodies
  and collision bounds. It threads sorted anchor ranges, uses SIMD overlap
  filtering, and emits range-owned candidate pairs once before deterministic
  merge.
- Narrowphase is a separate threaded batch: worker ranges SIMD-compute contact
  math over candidate pairs, then merge range-owned contact buffers
  deterministically for the same-step response stream.
- Thread-written broadphase and narrowphase range scratch is 64-byte padded;
  persistent collision component storage remains dense and unpadded by default.
- Broadphase and narrowphase keep separate adaptive tuners and batch stats; no
  combined timing trains either stage. Inline stage measurements still train the
  owning stage tuner, so a later expensive window can switch that stage to
  worker threads without borrowing another stage's profile.
- Collision response stays separate from detection; `CollisionResponseSystem`
  consumes the completed same-step contact stream through explicit
  response-policy components before structural commands commit.

Checklist:

- [x] Add persistent collision-shape or bounds data in `DataSystem` only for
      world objects that need collision or spatial queries.
- [x] Add a deterministic broadphase/spatial-query structure appropriate for the
      current 2D scale.
- [x] Add a contact output buffer and response processor boundary.
- [x] Add tests for stable contact ordering, stale entity rejection, and serial
      versus threaded query behavior where threading is used.
- [x] Add non-interactive collision benchmarks with quick-profile dense/sparse
      regression coverage, heavier 10k-50k standard-profile sweeps, and
      candidate/contact counters.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Collision queries operate from typed SoA data and stable IDs, not object
      callbacks.
- [x] Contact generation is deterministic for the same initial data and fixed
      update step.
- [x] Collision response cannot perform unsafe structural mutation inside worker
      ranges.

Slice 13 landed as a high-throughput collision-contact foundation. The collision
processor builds 64-byte-aligned AABB proxies from movement and collision bounds,
maintains warm sorted order, partitions sweep-and-prune work into deterministic
range windows, and emits transient contacts through `SimulationFrame`. The
response processor consumes the completed same-step contact stream through
`collision_response` components, keeps trigger output in a typed transient
stream, computes correction columns with `src/core/simd.zig`, and applies sparse
movement writes in deterministic contact order before structural commands
commit. The demo uses the same generic response path for player-obstacle,
moving-square-obstacle, and player-moving-square contacts. Detector benchmarks
report candidate pairs and contacts for dense/sparse body workloads, while
response benchmarks report triggers and intents across 1k-50k contact workloads.

## Slice 14: First AI Intent Processor And Future Rule Contracts

Goal: add the first data-driven non-player decision processor that emits
deterministic movement intents through `SimulationFrame`, proving the AI/rule
processor boundary before broader rule systems are added.

Current foundation:

- `DataSystem` and component masks can identify entity membership for processors.
- Movement and particle processors demonstrate the system API shape.
- Slice 12 provides deterministic event/intent/deferred-command contracts.
- Slice 13 provides spatial query and contact data for perception and
  collision-aware decisions.
- `DataSystem` owns aligned `AiAgent` SoA data, membership masks,
  structural-command validation, and dense movement lookup for AI rows.
- `AiSystem` reads `AiAgent` and movement slices, builds a transient 32-unit
  spatial grid, computes bounded local-separation samples, emits deterministic
  `MovementIntent` ranges into `SimulationFrame`, and uses serial or adaptive
  threaded execution for the separation and intent-emission stages.
- `GameDemoState` runs AI after main-thread player input and before movement
  integration, then applies AI movement intents on the main thread before
  `MovementSystem`.
- AI benchmarks cover serial, fixed-thread, and adaptive profiles for quick,
  standard, and stress workloads.
- `zig build fmt`, `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and `zig build verify`
  passed for this slice.

Architecture notes:

- State-owned feature controllers should orchestrate feature phases and budgets,
  not become hidden per-entity stores. They may take typed `DataSystem` views
  and run small policy passes, but hot or reusable loops should remain
  systems/processors over SoA slices.
- Future AI and rules should emit movement intents, steering outputs, target
  choices, typed requests/results, or deferred commands rather than mutating
  unrelated stores directly.
- AI separation and intent emission are independently staged and tuned. Future
  perception or rule passes need the same explicit work ownership,
  stage-specific tuning, and deterministic merge points.
- Deterministic randomness must be explicit state or an explicit service passed
  through the processor boundary.

Checklist:

- [x] Reuse `MovementIntent` and `RangeOutputStream` for the first AI steering
      output.
- [x] Define processor order for the first AI decision output, movement intent
      application, movement integration, collision response, and cleanup.
- [x] Keep current conflict policy narrow: single-writer AI movement intents are
      applied on the main thread in merged range order. Multi-system
      incompatible-intent arbitration remains future work.
- [x] Add tests for repeatable decisions, stable merge order, and no steady-state
      allocation in hot processors.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Non-player entities can be driven by data and processors rather than
      player-behavior copies.
- [x] The AI movement-intent processor produces deterministic outputs for fixed
      initial data, target, and random seed.
- [x] Processor outputs compose through typed data, intents, or deferred commands
      with explicit ownership and lifetime.

## Slice 15: SDL3_mixer Audio Service

Goal: add app-owned SFX and music support so gameplay states can request
immersive audio without owning SDL_mixer resources or moving audio calls into
threaded processors.

Current foundation:

- SDL3_mixer is a required system dependency beside SDL3 and SDL3_ttf.
- `AudioService` owns SDL_mixer initialization, the mixer device, reusable SFX
  tracks, one music track, loaded audio assets, failed-load memoization, bus
  gains, and pause ducking.
- `AudioCommandBuffer` carries state-owned audio intent through `UpdateContext`.
  States queue copied, traversal-safe relative paths during fixed-step updates;
  `Engine` drains commands on the main thread after state updates and transition
  application.
- The demo starts looping music once, updates the listener from the player, and
  emits debounced positional collision SFX from completed contact streams.

Checklist:

- [x] Link SDL3_mixer and include its C API through the platform SDL import.
- [x] Add audio config validation for track count, command cap, gains, and
      spatial scale.
- [x] Add an app-owned audio service and fixed-step command buffer.
- [x] Pass audio intent through `UpdateContext` without putting SDL_mixer handles
      in gameplay state or `DataSystem`.
- [x] Add demo music and collision SFX assets under `assets/audio/`.
- [x] Add tests for command validation, command caps, load caching, failed-load
      memoization, music idempotence, pause ducking, and spatial positioning.
- [x] Update architecture, setup, workflow, and repository guidance docs.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Gameplay states can request SFX and music without owning mixer handles.
- [x] Audio commands are bounded per fixed step and drained on the main thread.
- [x] Pause stops active SFX and ducks/resumes music gain.
- [x] Missing audio assets warn once per path instead of retrying every frame.
- [x] The demo proves music plus collision SFX through installed runtime assets.

## Slice 16: Main Menu and Settings Menu

Goal: provide a root main menu as the default startup state and a reachable settings menu for basic configurable options (initially live audio bus/master gains) so the app no longer boots directly into gameplay. Menus use the existing state stack (opaque + modal policies), input routing (new menu actions routed under the `.ui` context), text service for labels, renderer logical-space drawing, and audio command buffer for fixed-step gain changes.

Current foundation:

- `StateStack` + `StateTransitions` (replaceGameplay, replaceOwnedGameplay, pushModal, pop support added in this slice) and the four policies (gameplay / modal_overlay / pass_through_overlay / opaque_screen).
- `InputState` / `FrameCommands` + `input_router` with explicit `.ui` context and `modalUi`/`opaqueScreen` policies that already block gameplay movement while allowing app/debug/ui commands. Consumed state events suppress fallback routing into global frame commands.
- `TextService` cached text drawing/preparation (Slice 5) and explicit
  `Renderer.submitOrdered*` logical-space calls for already ordered UI helpers.
- `PauseState` provides the concrete drawing, stack-aware
  `UiDepth`/`RenderOrder.uiInStack(...)`, color, text-measurement, and
  centered-panel precedent.
- `AudioCommandBuffer.setMasterGain` / `setBusGain` + `AudioBus` (Slice 15) for live settings feedback without owning mixer resources. MainMenuState owns the runtime audio-setting values so they persist across settings reopen and into gameplay launch.
- `MainMenuState` launches `LoadingState`, which constructs `GameDemoState`
  from Engine-owned `RuntimeAssets` before replacing itself with gameplay.
- `bootstrapStartupState` in Engine with the explicit comment that a real MainMenuState was expected.
- Menus use `handleEvent` (raw SDL events, which reach top state for modal/opaque policies) and translate keys through `input.actionForKey(...)` before acting on named ui/app actions. `UpdateContext` carries input, audio for gain commands, runtime_assets for loading-state construction, transitions, and thread_system; `RenderContext` carries renderer + runtime_assets + optional text_service. This matches the actual `UpdateContext` definition (no one-frame commands field).
- All states follow the vtable shape with `init`/`deinit`/`update`/`render`/`handleEvent` and required `onPause`; `onResume` is optional.

Architecture notes:

- `StatePolicy.gameplay` is the source of truth for active gameplay; pause entry
  is gated by `StateStack.isGameplayActive()`.
- `pauseActive` / `resumeActive` target the gameplay-policy state, so overlays
  can sit on top without stealing gameplay pause notifications.
- Menu and settings states are non-gameplay UI states; pause attempts over them
  are inert.
- Settings are currently runtime menu state. Persistent settings file work
  should move pending adjustment persistence out of modal-local state so closing
  the settings menu cannot drop a not-yet-applied adjustment.

Checklist:

- [x] Add four menu navigation actions (`menuUp`/`menuDown`/`menuLeft`/`menuRight`) bound to arrow keys, classified as command actions, and routed to the `.ui` context. Update binding, routing, and action tests.
- [x] Extend `StateTransitions` and `StateStack` with `pop()` (request + apply + destroy) plus minimal tests so child menus can dismiss themselves cleanly.
- [x] Implement `MainMenuState` (src/game/main_menu_state.zig) as an opaque-screen root menu: 3 items, allocator storage for spawning GameDemo, selection + wrap, text-service-backed title+items with accent for selected, logical rect + text rendering, confirm via resumeGame action, quit action exits, transitions to gameplay or settings or app quit. Internal focused tests.
- [x] Implement `SettingsMenuState` (src/game/settings_menu_state.zig): 3 volume rows + Back, u8 0-10 state, menuLeft/menuRight records a pending adjustment for the selected volume, the next update queues set*Gain, labels render from current state, quit action or Back confirm does pop(), same visual style. Tests for clamping, emitted commands, pop, and command-failure consistency.
- [x] Update Engine bootstrap to create MainMenuState (opaque) at startup with logical size + allocator; keep GameDemo import for launch path. Update the old placeholder comment.
- [x] Register the two new game modules in src/tests.zig comptime block for `zig build test` coverage.
- [x] Add the full Slice 16 section (this text) to framework-implementation-slices.md following prior slice format, plus update Next Priority Tracks and the Suggested Order list.
- [x] Minor doc updates in state-stack-and-input.md (new actions in input model) and architecture.md (new states under game/, bootstrap note).
- [x] `zig build fmt`, `zig build test`, `zig build check`, `zig build verify` all pass.
- [x] Manual `zig build dev` smoke confirmed: arrow navigation + wrap, Enter starts demo, Esc quits from main, Settings reachable, Left/Right adjust volumes with audible result and label update, Back/Esc returns to main, gains persist into launched gameplay, F2 overlay works, no leaks on repeated transitions.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] App starts at a usable main menu (title + 3 keyboard-selectable items) instead of the demo.
- [x] Arrow keys change selection (wraps); Enter/Space activates; Esc quits from main menu.
- [x] "Start Game" replace-launches a fully functional GameDemoState (player input, systems, audio, pause overlay still work).
- [x] "Settings" pushes a modal settings view; Left/Right on volume rows records a pending gain change, the next update queues the gain command, labels update, and Esc or Back returns cleanly via pop.
- [x] Volume changes made in settings are respected when starting gameplay afterward.
- [x] Menu states store dirty non-owning `PreparedText` views, not generated
      text texture ownership; stable render frames draw prepared views directly
      and `TextService` owns the app-lifetime text cache.
- [x] Focused (no-window) tests cover action-mapped selection, wrap, transition requests (including pop), volume clamp + command emission, and command-failure consistency.
- [x] Updated routing tests prove menu actions are allowed exactly under ui/modal/opaque policies and blocked from pure gameplay routing.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes; docs updated in the canonical slices format.

Slice 16 lands the first real menu layer. The implementation stays deliberately small (no widget system, keyboard only, volumes as the single live setting) while covering the tested contract: state-driven navigation through named actions, consumed-event ui input routing, service-cached text + logical renderer drawing, fixed-step audio command effects from menus, clean pop + replace transitions, allocator hand-off for spawned gameplay, pause restricted to active gameplay, and complete tests + docs. Future menu work (controls, graphics stubs, in-game pause integration, persistence) can build directly on these states and the pop primitive.

## Slice 17: Startup Runtime Asset Catalog

Goal: preload the declared runtime asset set during `Engine.init` and make an
Engine-owned `RuntimeAssets` app service the source of stable sprite/audio
handles for gameplay, render prep, and audio commands. Missing declared content
should log once and mark that asset unavailable, but should not fail app
initialization.

Current foundation:

- `AssetStore` resolves traversal-safe runtime asset paths under the configured
  asset root.
- `AssetCache` decodes PNGs, uploads renderer textures, and returns retained
  `TextureLease` values.
- `AudioService` owns SDL3_mixer lifecycle, track pools, loaded audio handles,
  bus gains, and pause ducking.
- `Renderer` owns live GPU textures and draw submission.
- `DataSystem` stores persistent asset-reference component rows as stable
  `SpriteAssetId` values, but it does not own live renderer or audio resources.
- `RenderContext` exposes `RuntimeAssets`; `AudioCommandBuffer` carries stable
  `AudioAssetId` values plus playback parameters.

Architecture notes:

- `RuntimeAssets` lives under `src/assets/` and is an app service/catalog, not a
  gameplay processor under `src/game/systems/`.
- Add a typed code manifest for startup assets. It assigns stable IDs such as
  `SpriteAssetId` and `AudioAssetId` to relative asset paths.
- `Engine` owns `RuntimeAssets`. It preloads declared sprites/images through
  `AssetCache` after `Renderer` exists and preloads declared audio through
  `AudioService` after the mixer service exists.
- `RuntimeAssets` owns startup texture lease tokens, releases them explicitly
  through the live `AssetCache`/`Renderer` owner, and exposes prepared sprite
  metadata such as `{ texture, source_rect }`. Today each sprite can use a full
  texture; future atlas work can map the same `SpriteAssetId` to an atlas texture
  and source rectangle.
- `DataSystem` stores only stable sprite asset IDs as persistent entity component
  data. It may keep those component rows dense, but it must not store
  `TextureId`, `TextureLease`, prepared sprite records, SDL_mixer handles, or
  loaded audio handles.
- Runtime gameplay and render prep should use stable asset IDs, not string
  paths. Path validation, PNG decode, GPU upload, audio load/predecode, and
  string/hash lookup stay out of fixed update and hot render paths.
- Missing declared assets are logged and exposed as unavailable handles;
  allocation failures, invalid config, and SDL/GPU/audio service initialization
  failures still return errors.
- Startup preload remains in `Engine.init`; `LoadingState` now covers
  runtime-asset-backed gameplay construction. Larger streamed asset sets can
  extend that state with visible progress using the existing catalog status
  without changing ownership.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a typed startup asset manifest with stable sprite and audio IDs.
- [x] Add Engine-owned `RuntimeAssets` that preloads declared sprite/image
      assets during `Engine.init`, owns their texture leases, and releases them
      before renderer teardown.
- [x] Add audio preload support so declared music and SFX IDs resolve to loaded
      `AudioService` handles without path lookup during command drain.
- [x] Change render-facing code to resolve `SpriteAssetId` through
      `RuntimeAssets` instead of acquiring textures by relative path.
- [x] Change audio commands to carry `AudioAssetId` instead of copied relative
      paths.
- [x] Change `DataSystem` asset-reference component data from relative paths to
      stable `SpriteAssetId` values.
- [x] Add the first demo sprite asset under `assets/sprites/` and assign sprite
      IDs to player, AI squares, and obstacles.
- [x] Update render-facing demo code so deterministic entity drawing resolves
      sprite IDs through `RuntimeAssets` with primitive fallback for unavailable
      sprite IDs.
- [x] Update architecture and rendering/assets docs to describe startup preload,
      stable IDs, missing-asset behavior, and atlas-ready source rectangles.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Engine startup attempts to preload every declared sprite and audio asset
      once.
- [x] Missing declared content logs once, marks the asset unavailable, and does
      not abort app initialization.
- [x] Gameplay state, render-facing drawing, and audio commands use stable asset
      IDs rather than runtime string paths.
- [x] `DataSystem` contains no live renderer texture IDs, texture leases,
      prepared sprite records, SDL_mixer handles, or loaded audio handles.
- [x] Render-facing drawing resolves `SpriteAssetId` to
      `{ texture, source_rect }` and preserves deterministic draw ordering.
- [x] Future atlas mapping can change the catalog resolution without changing
      entity component storage.
- [x] `zig build fmt`, `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and
      `zig build verify` pass.
- [x] Manual `zig build dev` smoke confirms menu, gameplay, sprite rendering,
      audio, pause, debug overlay, and repeated transitions still work.

Slice 17 lands the startup runtime asset catalog. `Engine` now preloads the
manifest-declared demo sprite and audio set, gameplay stores stable sprite IDs,
rendering resolves IDs through `RuntimeAssets` with primitive fallback, and
audio commands drain by preloaded `AudioAssetId` instead of copied paths. The
catalog release path uses the live cache/renderer owner rather than
self-releasing lease pointers. Manual `zig build dev` validation confirmed menu,
gameplay, sprite rendering, audio, pause, debug overlay, and repeated
transitions.

---

## Later Settled Slices (8, 18–25E, 26–31, 34, 36)

## Slice 8: Shader And Platform Expansion

**Status: landed.** All Checklist and Acceptance checks below are `[x]`.

Goal: keep platform support reliable as shader count and target platforms grow.

Current foundation:

- SDL chooses the GPU backend from supplied shader formats.
- Linux builds SPIR-V, macOS builds MSL, and Windows builds DXIL.
- Runtime selects shader files from SDL-reported supported formats.
- Build metadata and runtime pipeline metadata are still updated in separate
  places until a shared shader/material manifest exists.

Architecture notes:

- Shader expansion should add render-owned material/pipeline metadata; it should
  not push shader, pipeline, or SDL_GPU handles into `DataSystem` or gameplay
  state.
- Lighting, fire, post-effect, and tile shaders should keep draw intent as
  stable asset/material IDs plus typed render order until render prep resolves
  them into queue records or a render-owned batcher stream.
- New batchers may be added for tile spans, light volumes, or effect particles,
  but they should consume an explicitly ordered stream or a documented
  render-owned phase with the same ordering guarantees. Do not add renderer
  fallback sorting to hide unordered producers.
- Build-time shader manifests and runtime pipeline registries should converge so
  adding a material does not require unrelated parallel edits.

Checklist:

- [x] Keep generated runtime shader files under `assets/shaders` in the install
      tree.
- [x] Add explicit Windows target output through DXIL.
- [x] Keep runtime backend selection SDL-driven; do not hard-code GPU driver names.
- [x] Consolidate shader-program, material, and runtime pipeline metadata so
      new pipelines do not need parallel registry edits.
- [x] Define the material/batcher routing contract for sprites, tile spans,
      lighting/fire effects, and post-effect passes without exposing SDL_GPU
      handles to game code.
- [x] Validate the right shader format list for each target OS.
- [x] Add direct runtime asset/shader lookup guidance or tests for direct binary
      execution outside the installed binary directory.
- [x] Add shader output checks for each supported target path.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] `zig build shaders` emits the same sprite shader outputs as before.
- [x] `zig build verify` exercises shader compilation.
- [x] `zig build gpu-smoke` confirms runtime submission on display-capable hosts.


## Slice 18: Frame-Delayed Pathfinding System

**Status: landed (historical).** Superseded nav core in Slice 25; contract retained.

> Note (superseded core): Slice 25 replaced the goal-field-centric core described
> below. The opportunistic per-step auto-grouped goal fields, the open-grid direct
> path / portal-detour fast paths, and the start-cell-in-key model are gone. The
> frame-delayed request/result contract, fixed-capacity caches, deterministic
> deferral, and adaptive thread scheduling remain. Read the Slice 25 section and
> `docs/architecture.md` for the as-built solver (per-agent budgeted A* + managed
> shared-goal flow field + chunk-portal abstract/cross-level tier). This slice is
> retained as historical record.

Goal: add a state-owned, frame-delayed grid pathfinding system so AI and rule
processors can request navigation without blocking current-step movement or
storing solver queues, caches, or scratch data in `DataSystem`.

Current foundation:

- Slice 12 provides typed transient streams and deterministic merge points
  through `SimulationFrame`.
- Slice 14 provides AI processors that can emit movement intent and consume
  later-step navigation results without owning solver state.
- `PathfindingSystem` lives under `src/game/systems/` as a system, not a
  controller. It owns a static versioned nav grid, pending request queue,
  request dedupe, completed result cache, unavailable-path cache, connected
  components, portal data, warmed fixed scratch buffers, shared goal fields, and
  per-stage adaptive tuners.
- `SimulationFrame.path_requests` carries transient path requests from AI to the
  pathfinder. Results are frame-delayed so AI consumes completed paths on later
  fixed steps instead of blocking current-step movement on fresh solves.
- Common requests avoid heap A* through request/result caches, unavailable-key
  caches, shared goal fields, open-grid direct paths, disconnected-component
  rejection, line-of-sight paths, and portal detours.
- Regular batch work uses `src/core/simd.zig` for request key preparation and
  static-grid blocked rectangle marking. Branch-heavy A* frontier expansion
  remains scalar inside worker ranges.
- Benchmarks split common-goal field reuse, hot cache-hit profiles, and hard
  fallback profiles. Cache profiles report `cache_hits`; hard fallback profiles
  report `fallback_requests` so regressions do not hide behind aggregate timing.

Architecture notes:

- Persistent gameplay facts stay in `DataSystem`; solver queues, caches,
  scratch buffers, nav-grid topology, and tuner state stay in the state-owned
  pathfinding system.
- Pathfinding uses read-only navigation snapshots during worker jobs and merges
  results deterministically before AI, movement, or response systems consume
  them.
- Adaptive tuning belongs to the actual work stage being measured. Shared goal
  field construction, fallback solves, and result emission should each either
  stay inline by design or use the tuner that measures that exact batch shape.
- Heap A* is a bounded fallback path, not the expected per-frame path for common
  requests. Hard true-A* fixtures and solve budgets remain a future hardening
  track.

Checklist:

- [x] Add typed path requests and completed path results through
      `SimulationFrame`.
- [x] Add a state-owned `PathfindingSystem` under `src/game/systems/` and wire
      it into fixed-step gameplay order after AI request emission.
- [x] Keep solver state, warmed scratch buffers, caches, and adaptive tuners out
      of `DataSystem`.
- [x] Add request/result cache hits, unavailable-path caching, request dedupe,
      and pending-request dedupe so repeat work stays cheap.
- [x] Add shared goal fields and regular-batch SIMD where the data shape is
      suitable.
- [x] Add fast paths for direct open-grid paths, unreachable component rejects,
      line-of-sight paths, and portal detours before heap A* fallback.
- [x] Add deterministic serial, fixed-thread, and adaptive benchmarks for common
      field reuse, hot cache-shaped workloads, and hard fallback workloads with
      visible cache/fallback counters.
- [x] Add tests covering deterministic results, cache behavior, no hot-loop heap
      allocation in steady-state paths, unavailable requests, and serial versus
      threaded consistency.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] AI can request paths without blocking the current fixed-step movement
      integration on a fresh solve.
- [x] Pathfinding is modeled as a gameplay system over typed data and transient
      requests, not as a persistent gameplay-state owner.
- [x] Repeated, unavailable, open-grid, detour, and shared-goal requests use
      cheaper paths before heap A*.
- [x] Adaptive and threaded runs are benchmarked against serial runs with
      fallback counters visible.
- [x] Debug and ReleaseFast 1024-request benchmarks cover open unique, detour,
      and unreachable fixtures; all report zero fallback requests for the fast
      fixtures after the fixture correction.
- [x] `zig build test --summary all`, `zig build check`, `zig build verify`, and
      `git diff --check` pass for the pathfinding implementation.

Slice 18 lands the navigation substrate. It gives AI and future rule systems a
deterministic, frame-delayed path request/result boundary with caches, fixed
scratch, SIMD-friendly batch work, and adaptive thread-system scheduling. It
does not by itself make NPC behavior immersive; steering, avoidance, perception,
and behavior arbitration remain the next gameplay layers.


## Slice 19: Steering And Local Avoidance

Goal: turn pathfinding results into smoother NPC movement by adding local
steering, avoidance, and stuck/replan policy above the pathfinder without moving
that transient behavior into `DataSystem`.

Current foundation:

- Slice 14 AI processing provides deterministic AI decision output; Slice 19
  routes that output through navigation intents before final steering movement.
- Slice 18 pathfinding can provide frame-delayed path waypoints and unavailable
  results.
- Slice 13 collision contacts and spatial-query foundations provide the data
  shape needed for local crowd and obstacle decisions.
- `SteeringSystem` consumes high-level navigation intents, pathfinding status,
  dense steering components, movement slices, and static obstacle data, then
  emits final NPC movement intents through deterministic threaded range writes
  after main-thread path/status preparation.

Architecture notes:

- Steering should be a system or state-owned feature controller that consumes
  path results and typed SoA views, then emits movement intents or rule outputs.
- Persistent tuning data such as agent radius, desired speed, or avoidance class
  may live in dense `DataSystem` components. Per-step neighbor lists, waypoint
  cursors, avoidance scratch, and replan queues should stay transient or
  state-owned.
- Avoidance and steering benchmarks should measure the processor cost directly
  rather than masking it behind the pathfinding benchmark.

Checklist:

- [x] Add path-following state needed to turn completed paths into movement
      intents.
- [x] Add local obstacle and agent avoidance using bounded fixed scratch.
- [x] Add stuck detection, replan cooldowns, and unavailable-path backoff.
- [x] Define arbitration between player input, AI steering, collision response,
      and future rule outputs.
- [x] Add deterministic tests for waypoint following, avoidance ordering, replan
      backoff, and no steady-state hot-loop allocation.
- [x] Add steering/local-avoidance benchmarks that report agent count, bounded
      avoidance checks, accepted samples, intents emitted, and threaded/adaptive
      detail where used.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] NPCs can follow path waypoints without sharp frame-to-frame oscillation.
- [x] Nearby NPCs and static obstacles are avoided through bounded local work.
- [x] Unavailable or stale paths do not cause per-frame re-request loops.
- [x] Steering outputs compose through typed movement intents or rule outputs
      with deterministic order.
- [x] `zig build fmt`, `zig build test`, `zig build check`, `zig build verify`,
      and `zig build bench -- --profile quick --group steering --details` pass.

Slice 19 lands steering as a separate gameplay processor. AI now emits
`NavigationIntent` goals, `SteeringSystem` owns runtime steering rows,
path-request cooldown/backoff, local avoidance scratch, deterministic priority
arbitration, and threaded final movement-intent emission. Only the steering
stage writes final NPC `MovementIntent`s. Player movement remains direct input,
and collision response still resolves after movement.

**Hardening follow-up (post-Slice 27, no new slice number):** chasing a moving
goal (the player) produced a visible NPC direction wiggle — a discrete flip in
the chosen base direction (path-following vs. direct-fallback toggling while a
goal-cell requantization is in flight, a fresh corridor replacing a stale
waypoint, or a wander-epoch change) snapped the heading in one step instead of
turning smoothly. `RuntimeRow` gained `prev_dir_x/y`/`has_prev_dir`, and
`smoothBaseDirection` (steering.zig) blends the previous emitted direction
toward the new target by `steering_turn_smoothing = 0.15` per fixed step
(~10 steps to mostly converge at 60Hz) before it reaches
`SelectedWorkRow.base_dir`. The first direction observed for a runtime row is
used as-is (no startup lag). Benchmarked before/after on `zig build bench --
group steering` at 128/512/1024 agents: no measurable regression (differences
within normal run-to-run noise).


## Slice 20: Navigation Hardening And Hard-Path Budgets

> Note (superseded core): Slice 25 supersedes the goal-field core and the
> opportunistic fast paths this slice hardened. The node-budget concept it
> introduced lives on as the per-agent A* `max_explored_nodes` budget and the
> abstract `max_abstract_nodes` budget; the budget-spill-returns-`pending`
> contract is unchanged. The auto-grouped goal fields it tuned are replaced by the
> declared managed shared-goal flow field. Retained as historical record.

Goal: keep rare true-A* and complex-map navigation costs bounded, tested, and
visible so pathfinding remains a stable gameplay foundation as map and NPC
counts grow.

Current foundation:

- Slice 18 benchmark profiles expose common fast paths and fallback counters.
- Pathfinding stats already distinguish field requests, cache hits,
  unavailable-path cache hits, and fallback requests.
- `PathfindingSystem` keeps solver queues, result caches, unavailable-key state,
  goal fields, scratch, and tuners out of `DataSystem`.

Architecture notes:

- Benchmarks should distinguish common-path throughput from true hard-path
  fallback costs. A slow fallback should be treated as a visible budget decision,
  not hidden by aggregate adaptive numbers.
- Solve budgets should prefer deterministic deferral over unbounded same-frame
  work. If the pathfinder cannot finish all fallback work inside the budget, it
  should report pending work explicitly.
- The current per-step solve and hard-fallback budgets default to 128 requests.
  This is a ReleaseFast-tuned crowd baseline: a 2000 hard-request pressure run
  solves 128 and reports the remaining backlog instead of stalling the fixed
  update.
- Slice 20 intentionally keeps cache aging, incremental A* continuation, module
  splitting, and pipeline extraction out of scope. The completed feature is the
  bounded hard-path contract, fixed-capacity cache coverage, and benchmark
  visibility.

Checklist:

- [x] Add true-A*-required fixtures that cannot be solved by direct, field,
      component, or portal fast paths.
- [x] Add per-frame fallback solve budgets and deterministic pending/deferred
      behavior for overflow work.
- [x] Add completed-result, entity-result, unavailable-key, and goal-field
      fixed-capacity tests.
- [x] Add benchmark callouts for Debug and ReleaseFast hard-path throughput and
      budget-pressure workloads.
- [x] Audit heap use and scratch sizing for worst-case fallback fixtures through
      warmed no-allocation hard-path tests.
- [x] Keep pathfinding as a gameplay system; do not split modules or promote it
      into a controller as part of this slice.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Benchmarks report true fallback count, deferred budget pressure, and
      timing separately from fast-path work.
- [x] Unreachable or impossible destinations are rejected once and cached rather
      than re-solved every frame.
- [x] Fallback overflow defers deterministically instead of stalling the fixed
      update.
- [x] Hard-path changes cannot silently regress common request throughput because
      benchmark detail rows expose fallback, deferred, result, and eviction
      counters.
- [x] `zig build fmt`, `zig build test --summary all`, `zig build check`,
      `zig build verify`, and targeted Debug/ReleaseFast pathfinding benchmarks
      pass.

Slice 20 lands navigation hardening as a complete foundation feature. True A*
fallback work now has a separate per-step request budget, budget overflow stays
pending in stable order, cache capacity behavior is tested, and hard-fallback
benchmarks expose executed fallback work, deferred fallback work, remaining
pending work, results, and cache evictions across raw-throughput and
budget-pressure groups. The runtime defaults allow 128 true fallback solves per
step, with `--fallback-budget` available for ReleaseFast tuning sweeps.


## Slice 21: Typed Simulation Event System And Domain Signals

Goal: add a deterministic, typed simulation event layer that lets future
gameplay/domain systems communicate important system changes and interactions,
including tile, pathfinding, AI, obstacle, weather, combat, spawning, rules, and
resource changes, without introducing a global pub/sub bus, hidden persistent
state, or hot-path dynamic dispatch.

Current foundation:

- Slice 12 already provides `SimulationFrame`, typed transient streams,
  `RangeOutputStream(T)`, deterministic range-index merge, and deferred
  structural command boundaries.
- Collision, AI, steering, and pathfinding already use specialized typed
  streams for high-volume or latency-sensitive outputs: contacts, navigation
  intents, movement intents, path requests, and structural commands.
- `SimulationEvents` now owns lower-volume typed domain-signal records inside
  `SimulationFrame`, with deterministic range-owned writes, immutable merged
  reads, explicit per-step event capacity, event stats, and dropped diagnostic
  counts.
- `GameDemoState` consumes structural events after the deferred commit point and
  emits navigation invalidation when static obstacle-affecting structural
  changes require a pathfinding grid rebuild.
- `DataSystem` is the persistent gameplay-fact owner; transient event, request,
  scratch, queue, and service state stay outside persistent component storage.
  `DataSystem` remains the single source for applying structural commands and
  reports plain structural change records that `SimulationFrame` maps into
  events after the commit succeeds.

Architecture notes:

- Map this feature to the intended simulation structure explicitly:
  `StateStack` dispatches states; a gameplay state owns `DataSystem`,
  `SimulationFrame`, and, when shared orchestration is needed, a
  `SimulationPipeline`; the pipeline owns event phases and domain-controller
  order; controllers consume typed event slices and decide reactions;
  processors do hot SoA work and emit typed outputs; `DataSystem` stores
  persistent facts; `SimulationFrame` stores this-step communication.
- Use events to communicate that something important changed or that a later
  stage should consider a request. Use `DataSystem` to store what remains true
  after the step. Use controllers to decide how domains react. Use processors
  for scalable data work. Use deferred commands for structural mutation.
- The event layer is state-owned through `SimulationFrame` for one gameplay
  state instance. A future `SimulationPipeline` can own event reaction order
  without changing event storage or producer APIs. The event layer is not an app
  service, global singleton, reflection system, string-topic dispatcher,
  callback chain, or dynamic dependency graph.
- Events communicate domain or system changes that happened this step, or
  requests that a later fixed stage should consider. Persistent facts such as
  tile state, obstacle occupancy, weather fields, faction state, resources,
  actor components, or long-lived rule state still live in `DataSystem` or
  state-owned domain storage.
- The first concrete payloads are structural lifecycle/component change signals
  and `NavRegionInvalidated`. Add later domain payloads as explicit union
  variants with focused emit/read tests; do not add placeholder systems for
  domains that do not exist yet.
- Keep existing high-volume streams specialized. Collision contacts, movement
  intents, navigation intents, path requests, and render-prep command streams
  should not be collapsed into one generic simulation-event stream just for
  uniformity. Events may invalidate or wake a render producer, but render prep
  still emits explicit ordered commands with typed `RenderOrder`.
- Threaded producers must use the same count/prefix/write/range-index merge
  model as other `SimulationFrame` streams. Output order must come from stable
  phase, input, range, and per-range sequence order, not worker timing.
- Event consumers run at explicit reaction points after a producer stage has
  finished and the stream has merged. Consumers own their reaction work instead
  of dumping it into a generic main-thread bucket: light orchestration may stay
  inline, while expensive reactions should split over immutable event slices and
  write their own range-owned outputs.
- Main-thread reaction work must name the ownership boundary it preserves, such
  as structural commit, SDL/GPU/audio ownership, state transition, asset
  loading, save/load streaming, renderer resource ownership, or measured light
  orchestration. This is a project-wide rule: do not move scalable work in any
  subsystem to the main thread simply to make ordering or testing easier.
- Avoid recursive event storms. If consuming one event emits more events, the
  design must name the next event phase or defer to the next fixed step instead
  of allowing unbounded immediate redispatch.
- Events must carry stable IDs, scalar data, enum tags, compact coordinates,
  and small value payloads only. Do not store pointers, renderer/audio/SDL
  handles, asset paths, loaded resources, allocators, or service references in
  event payloads.
- Production contracts in any subsystem must not gain test-only tags, marker
  fields, fake stages, fixture hooks, or testing-only service paths. Event,
  intent, structural-command, ID, component, render, asset, app, platform, and
  tool APIs should expose runtime concepts only. Tests should use private helper
  record types, local fixtures, test-only mocks, or real production payloads.
- Simulation-event diagnostics should expose counts by type and
  producer/controller stage. Logging individual events in hot paths is not
  acceptable outside targeted debug tooling.

Checklist:

- [x] Define `SimulationEvent` payloads for the first concrete cross-system
      signals: structural entity/component changes and navigation invalidation.
- [x] Add a state-owned event collection API under the simulation/pipeline
      boundary, reusing `RangeOutputStream` or an equivalent typed
      count/prefix/write collector.
- [x] Define event phases, producer-stage merge points, explicit reaction
      points, derived-event policy, and no-recursive-dispatch behavior.
- [x] Add domain-reaction integration for current gameplay state orchestration:
      structural events can trigger one nav-grid rebuild and a typed
      `NavRegionInvalidated` event without moving persistent facts out of
      `DataSystem`.
- [x] Add capacity and reserve policy for event channels, including behavior
      when a low-priority event channel exceeds its per-step budget. Required
      events preflight the configured event budget before structural mutation or
      domain-reaction side effects; diagnostic events drop and increment stats.
- [x] Add event stats with per-type counts, dropped/deferred counts where
      applicable, and stage/controller attribution for benchmarks or debug UI.
- [x] Document which cross-system communication should use simulation/domain
      events and which should remain a specialized stream such as contacts,
      movement intents, navigation intents, path requests, render-prep commands,
      or structural commands.
- [x] Document the architecture mapping for event producers and consumers:
      pipeline phase, controller owner, persistent data owner, transient event
      stream, processor outputs, and deferred mutation point.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Replaying the same initial `DataSystem`, controller state, fixed-step
      inputs, and worker split decisions produces the same event order and same
      downstream outputs.
- [x] Threaded producers merge events deterministically by stable range order,
      never by worker completion order.
- [x] Event consumption cannot mutate `DataSystem` structurally except through
      deferred structural commands applied at the pipeline commit point.
- [x] Event payload tests reject or avoid pointers, app/render/audio handles,
      asset paths, allocator references, and other non-stable runtime state.
- [x] Capacity tests cover reserve, appended and range-owned overflow,
      diagnostic drop policy, structural preflight before mutation, and
      no-allocation warmed event production.
- [x] Event stats expose counts by type/stage and dropped diagnostic counts so
      current structural and navigation interactions do not become invisible
      fixed-step cost.
- [x] Production contracts contain only runtime payloads; tests use private
      fixtures, test-only mocks, or real payloads instead of leaking testing
      markers into production enums/unions or service APIs.

Slice 21 lands the typed event infrastructure as a current runtime contract:
events are deterministic phase outputs inside `SimulationFrame`, threaded
producers use the same range-owned merge model as other streams, stats are
range-owned during production and merged deterministically, consumers run at
explicit reaction points, and high-volume streams remain specialized. The first
concrete domain reaction is navigation
invalidation from static obstacle-affecting structural changes.


## Slice 22: Simulation Pipeline And Tier/Scope Scaffolding

Goal: make `SimulationPipeline` the state-owned fixed-step simulation owner,
add the tier/scope scaffolding in its final ownership locations, and preserve
today's full active-set processor behavior. This is the architectural landing
zone for later scoped simulation, not the slice that turns on world/chunk tier
filtering.

Design source of truth:

- [architecture.md](architecture.md) for durable pipeline, controller,
  tier/scope, and ownership guidance.
- [simulation-tiers-and-pipeline.md](simulation-tiers-and-pipeline.md) for the
  current `SimulationFrame` streams, events, and structural-command contracts
  that the pipeline extraction must preserve.

Current foundation:

- Slice 12 provides `SimulationFrame`, `SimulationPhase`, typed streams, and
  deferred structural commits.
- `SimulationPipeline` owns reusable fixed-step simulation systems and today's
  ordered processor dispatch for one gameplay state instance.
- `GameDemoState.update` applies main-thread input/audio, delegates processor
  dispatch to `SimulationPipeline`, applies structural commits, and keeps
  dynamic render-prep scratch reserved for current primitive-visual rows.
- `GameDemoState.render` collects dynamic render records once, sorts them by
  world z, then merges them with visible world z layers. The player marker and
  particles are explicit render producers outside fixed-step simulation.
- Processors gather dense `DataSystem` slices and support threaded serial
  parity paths with benchmarks into the 50k stress scale.
- Architecture docs describe `SimulationPipeline` as the long-term owner of
  phase order, budgets, system ownership, and concrete domain-controller
  composition.

Architecture notes:

- Tiers are persistent membership; scope is per-step active filtering; the
  pipeline is one ordered stage list with gated inputs. Slice 22 defines those
  contracts, stores cold tier/chunk metadata, reports default full-active
  stats, and keeps runtime filtering deferred until world rendering and
  chunk/visibility data exist.
- Tier and chunk metadata stay on cold `EntitySlot` data, not hot movement SoA
  columns, unless profiling proves otherwise.
- Processors stay dumb: scoped gather entry points filter inputs without
  learning world/chunk/camera policy.
- Tier promotion/demotion commits at the deferred structural boundary or an
  explicit main-thread commit, not inside worker ranges.
- Slice 21 events/controllers are the long-term tier transition source; spatial
  chunk policy is the first concrete source after world rendering lands.
- Benchmark 50k counts prove spike absorption; typical gameplay should scope
  active cognition/collision far lower every frame.
- Render preparation remains a separate render-facing phase after fixed-step
  simulation data is ready. The pipeline can determine which entities are in
  active scope, visible scope, or dirty regions, but it should hand immutable
  slices and scope lists to render prep rather than calling `Renderer` or
  owning render-prep ordering.

Implementation context to preserve:

- This slice is still the planned pipeline + tier/scope architecture, not a
  reduced pipeline-only cleanup. It should scaffold `SimulationScope`,
  `SimulationTier`, `ActiveRegion`, cold tier/chunk metadata, full-active scope
  construction, and scope stats in the places where later scoped runtime
  behavior will hook in.
- The extraction makes the next implementation easier by moving system
  ownership, phase driving, and ordered processor dispatch behind a state-owned
  simulation owner. It should not erase the already-decided tier, scope,
  controller, render-handoff, or event-driven transition plan.
- Keep the current order visible while extracting it: main-thread inputs,
  AI navigation intent production, steering/path status consumption,
  pathfinding, sparse movement-intent application, movement integration,
  player bounds clamp, collision detection, collision response, particle/domain
  reactions, structural commit, and post-commit render-prep reservation.
- Scoped runtime behavior remains required after world rendering provides real
  tile/chunk/visibility data. The initial full-active-set pipeline and tier
  scaffolding are architectural stepping stones; they must not be documented as
  completed scoped tier behavior.

Checklist:

- [x] Add `src/game/simulation_pipeline.zig` with a state-owned
      `SimulationPipeline` that owns today's reusable systems and drives the
      ordered fixed-step sequence over `DataSystem` and `SimulationFrame`.
- [x] Change `GameDemoState` to own one `SimulationPipeline` and delegate the
      processor dispatch from `update` without changing behavior for the full
      active set.
- [x] Add `src/game/simulation_scope.zig` with `SimulationTier`, `ActiveRegion`,
      `SimulationScope`, full-active default construction, scope stats, and
      validation helpers.
- [x] Add cold tier/chunk metadata on `EntitySlot` or equivalent compact storage
      with default values that preserve today's behavior for all existing
      entities.
- [x] Keep player input, audio command emission, structural commit/domain
      reactions, render enqueue, and private clamp/sync helpers in
      `GameDemoState`, while interpolation sync delegates pipeline-owned
      movement history to `SimulationPipeline`.
- [x] Add full-set delegation/parity tests that prove the pipeline extraction
      preserves phase order, stream outputs, structural commit behavior, render
      queue reservation, and simulation stats.
- [x] Add tests proving tier/chunk metadata defaults, validation, and full-active
      scope construction do not change current simulation output.
- [x] Leave scoped processor filtering, stagger/reduced cadence, and real
      chunk/visibility gates disabled until the post-world-rendering scoped tier
      slice.

Post-22 deferred items (Slice 24 landed unless noted): open work is tracked in
**Scaling Gaps And Hardening Frontier** (visible-index handoff, multi-world scope).

- [x] Scoped gathers, stagger, scope stats, and architecture cross-links (Slice 24).
- [x] Inline camera gating at collect time (Slice 24B); warmed visible-index list
      remains open (Scaling Gaps — render scale).
- [ ] Multi-world scope policy and render-prep visible-index handoff (Scaling Gaps).

Acceptance checks:

- [x] `GameDemoState` delegates fixed-step processor dispatch to
      `SimulationPipeline` with no behavior change for today's full active set.
- [x] Tier/scope scaffolding exists in the final owner modules and storage
      locations, with default full-active behavior and validation tests.
- [x] Scope stats report the full-active counts without changing processor
      participation, adding per-frame logging, or adding benchmark timers to
      runtime rendering.
- [x] The slice does not claim scoped-tier completion: scoped gathers, stagger
      policy, real chunk gates, and tier transitions remain unchecked in this
      slice until world rendering supplies concrete world/chunk inputs.
- [x] `zig build test` covers pipeline phase transitions, full-active scope
      construction, metadata defaults, and no behavior change without opening a
      window.

**Status: landed (scaffolding).** `SimulationPipeline` owns fixed-step processor
orchestration; scoped runtime behavior landed in Slice 24. Scope metadata now
lives on movement-body dense columns (Slice 24), not cold `EntitySlot` fields as
originally sketched below — code is authoritative.


## Slice 23: Atlas-Backed World Rendering Addition

Goal: add a minimal world/tile rendering foundation that uses the existing
world tileset atlas metadata and render-prep boundary. This gives scoped
simulation concrete world, chunk, and visibility data to consume later.

Current foundation:

- Runtime assets preload atlas textures and metadata for `.world_tileset`,
  `.grim_characters`, and `.grim_items`.
- `world_tileset_meta.zig` validates tile JSON and exposes tile lookup by name,
  id, category, animation, and source rect.
- Explicit render-prep phases own transient draw-record ordering and `Renderer`
  owns SDL_GPU submission.

Architecture notes:

- World/tile state lives in the state-owned `WorldSystem`, not in renderer
  resources and not inside `SimulationPipeline`.
- `GameDemoState` is constructed from Engine-owned `RuntimeAssets` through a
  loading state; world construction requires `.world_tileset` metadata and
  world rendering requires the `.world_tileset` texture.
- The runtime loading path now uses the Engine-owned `ThreadSystem` for
  deterministic procedural chunk generation; it does not create a separate
  worker pool.
- Persistent world storage is SoA: stable tile IDs, atlas source-rect columns,
  level z metadata, dense/sparse tile columns, and chunk/visibility columns.
- Gameplay viewport size is separate from world size. The first large runtime
  world is a finite 512x512 tile segment with camera-visible chunk rendering,
  intended as a foundation for later larger-map streaming.
- The first world renderer exposes enough chunk/visibility shape for the later
  scoped tier slice, but it does not enable simulation tier filtering by itself.
- Demo actors can use character atlas entries with primitive-visual rectangle
  fallback; world tiles do not have a rectangle fallback path.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a small world/tile data owner with tile IDs, world coordinates, and
      chunk/visibility metadata suitable for later `ActiveRegion` construction.
- [x] Render at least one world/tile layer from `.world_tileset` atlas metadata
      through ordered render prep.
- [x] Keep tile draw ordering explicit by `RenderOrder` and stable source rects.
- [x] Add tests for tile lookup, strict missing atlas texture behavior,
      actor primitive fallback, and deterministic queue record order.
- [x] Add tests for ThreadSystem-driven procedural chunk generation,
      camera-follow world bounds, visible chunk culling, and world-tile
      pathfinding blockers.
- [x] Update rendering/assets docs and roadmap cross-links after runtime wiring
      lands.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Demo/world rendering uses atlas metadata instead of per-tile textures or
      runtime string lookup.
- [x] World/chunk/visibility data exists in a form the later scoped tier slice
      can consume without ownership rewrites.
- [x] Render-prep benchmarks still measure the queue-to-batch path outside the
      production render path.
- [x] `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and `zig build verify` pass.

Slice 23 adds `WorldSystem` as `GameDemoState`-owned SoA world storage and
render prep. `LoadingState` now bridges menu activation to runtime-asset-backed
gameplay construction, fixing the old direct demo-state constructor boundary.
The demo renders a dense atlas-backed floor layer plus sparse world decoration
through ordered render prep, carries level/chunk/visibility columns for future
scoped simulation, and keeps `SimulationPipeline` focused on fixed-step entity
processors. Demo actors now reference `.grim_characters` atlas entries while
retaining primitive visuals as missing-character placeholders.
The runtime loading path now builds a 512x512 procedural segment with
`ThreadSystem` chunk batches, follows the player with an interpolated sub-pixel
camera, and renders only camera-visible chunks. World blocking tiles are folded
into the pathfinding nav-grid rebuild alongside static entity obstacles.

Follow-up slices **23A** (render hardening landed on `expand2`) and **23B**
(multi-depth render scaling for ~120 levels) extend this foundation; see below.


## Slice 23A: GPU Tilemap Render Hardening

Goal: harden Slice 23's retained GPU tilemap path for production digging and
multi-level compositing — correct depth ordering, safe partial tile uploads,
batched copy-pass staging, and pre-acquire CPU prep — without changing
simulation or `dig_controller` contracts.

Problem (observed on `expand2` before hardening):

- A linear `mergeDrawList` assumed static groups were pre-sorted by depth, but
  `submitStaticDenseGeometry` appended dense layers in storage order (surface
  first). That inverted underground compositing (grass/dirt flip, wrong plane
  visible through holes).
- Batched copy-pass staging passed `cycle=true` on the final upload when tile
  edits were the last work in the pass. Retained per-layer `GRAPHICS_STORAGE_READ`
  tile buffers require `cycle=false`; otherwise each dig ping-ponged GPU tile
  storage and flipped dirt/grass visually while CPU state stayed correct.
- Tile edits staged before swapchain acquire could be dropped on skipped frames
  when using clear-replace upload queues.

Current foundation (landed on `expand2`, runtime-validated):

- `mergeDrawList` stable-sorts static+dynamic groups by `RenderOrder` before
  coalescing; regression test covers unsorted underground dense depths.
- `submitStaticDenseGeometry` collects visible layers, sorts back-to-front by
  render depth at submit, and respects `active_level` (skip floors above the
  player). Re-submits on `dense_quads_dirty` or plane change only.
- `recordFrameCopyPass` batches dynamic vertices, optional static vertices, and
  tile edits in one copy pass; `uploadsRemainingCycle` counts **vertex** uploads
  only. Tile storage uses `recordStorageRegionsInPass` with **always
  `cycle=false`** and `MapGPUTransferBuffer(..., false)` for edit staging.
- `uploadTileDataEdits` appends pending edits (survives skipped frames); digs
  flush at the render boundary via `WorldSystem.flushDenseTileEdits`.
- Pre-acquire path: `prepareFrameCommands` / vertex staging before swapchain
  acquire; tile edits recorded after acquire in the frame copy pass (matches
  retained-buffer lifetime).
- `render_prep.submitGameplayFrame` owns layered world submit (static dense →
  tile-edit flush → sparse/dynamic z-walk); grow-only renderer reservations.

GPU upload `cycle` contract (do not regress):

| Resource | `cycle` on upload |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic/static **vertex** ring streams | `true` on last vertex upload in the copy pass |
| **Tile-data storage** buffers (per-layer, retained) | **always `false`** |
| Tile-edit transfer buffer map | **`false`** |

Checklist:

- [x] Restore stable-sort `mergeDrawList` and add unsorted dense-layer regression
      test.
- [x] Sort dense layers back-to-front in `submitStaticDenseGeometry` before append.
- [x] Enforce `cycle=false` for all tile-storage uploads and tile-edit staging.
- [x] Exclude tile edits from vertex `uploadsRemainingCycle`; batch tile edits in
      the post-acquire copy pass.
- [x] Append pending tile edits across skipped frames; flush once per gameplay
      frame at the render boundary.
- [x] Keep dig/simulation ownership in `dig_controller` / `WorldSystem` CPU tile
      fields; render path consumes queued edits only.
- [x] Extend `render-game-prep` bench static depths to realistic underground
      stack order (`-2`, `-18`, `-34`).
- [ ] Land as a coherent commit stack on `expand2` and merge to `world`.
- [x] Document `cycle` rules in `docs/rendering-assets-shaders.md`.
- [ ] Optional: restore O(n) linear `mergeDrawList` now that submit-side sort is
      guaranteed (micro-opt; measure first).

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Dig hole/fall/ramp simulation tests pass unchanged (`dig_controller`,
      `game_demo_state`).
- [x] Visual layer stack correct: grass above dirt, carved tunnels show the plane
      below, no per-dig dirt/grass flip.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.
- [x] `zig build gpu-smoke` exercises tilemap storage-buffer binds (`gpu_smoke_impl.zig`
      submits `appendStaticTilemapSpan` with retained tile-data buffer).

Status: landed on `expand2`; optional linear `mergeDrawList` micro-opt and
`expand2` → `world` merge remain backlog.


## Slice 23B: Multi-Depth Dense-Layer Render Scaling

Goal: make the Slice 23A retained tilemap path scale to large vertical worlds
(~120 depth levels, more entities) without linear draw-count and memory blow-up
at the surface, while preserving the 23A GPU upload invariants.

Problem (current envelope):

- One draw + one full-world storage buffer per **submitted** dense layer. At
  `active_level = 0` every layer at or below the player is submitted — for 120
  floors that is 120 draws and ~120 MB GPU tile data at 512² (manageable on
  desktop, wrong policy for steady-state frame cost).
- `k_max_dense_submit_layers = 16` in `world_system.zig` hard-fails beyond 16
  visible dense layers — blocks the first content expansion.
- `mergeDrawList` is O(n log n) in group count; acceptable at a bounded window,
  not at 120+ static groups every frame at the surface.
- Entity render prep already scales via SoA collect + `spriteCommandCapacity`;
  dense floors are the primary new cost — not per-tile vertex streaming.

Architecture notes:

- Simulation and nav already support multi-level worlds (Slice 25 per-level grids,
  `LevelLink`, incremental rebuild). This slice is **render visibility policy**
  only — no dig logic or nav contract changes.
- Slice 24 cube LOD already demotes off-level / far entities on the **sim**
  axis; 23B is the matching **render** axis for dense floor layers.
- Slice 25E adds per-entity depth alignment and entity render cull; dense-floor
  window policy stays in `WorldSystem` / `render_prep`.
- Chunked or streaming tilemaps are out of scope here unless profiling forces
  them; prefer a vertical **render window** first.

Recommended policy (default unless gameplay disproves it):

- Submit dense layers only in `[active_level .. active_level + N]` (N tuned to
  visible stack depth, e.g. 4–8) plus any layers required for surface-hole
  see-through (at most one ceiling band above the player when standing on
  level 0).
- Size `k_max_dense_submit_layers`, `reserveStaticGeometry`, and
  `draw_list_high_water` from the chosen window — not from total world depth.
- Pre-size GPU tile-data buffers for all authored dense layers at load (memory
  is level-count × cell count); culling affects **draw/submit** only unless a
  later slice adds buffer residency policy.

Current foundation (landed):

- `DenseLayerRenderWindow` in `world_system.zig`: default `levels_below = 6`,
  `ceiling_when_underground = false` (render slice follows `player_level` /
  `active_level`; surface hole see-through uses the below window at level 0).
  Optional `ceiling_when_underground` redraws one level above when enabled.
  `levelInWindow` gates submit;
  `maxSubmitLayers` sizes the window from per-level dense-band cap.
- `maxDenseSubmitLayerCount`, `validateDenseRenderBudget`, and
  `collectDenseSubmitLayers` replace the demo-only 16-layer hard cap;
  `k_max_dense_submit_stack_cap = 32` is a defensive submit-time guard.
  `WorldBuildConfig.render_window` and optional `max_dense_tile_gpu_bytes`
  fail loud at world build (`initDemo` / `initProcedural`).
- `submitStaticDenseGeometry` collects only in-window layers, sorts
  back-to-front, and re-submits on `dense_quads_dirty`, `active_level`, or
  window change. `GameplayScene.player_level` drives the handoff.
- `render_prep.ensureStaticGeometryCapacity` reserves static geometry from
  `WorldSystem.maxDenseSubmitLayerCount()` at the start of `submitGameplayFrame`
  (grow-only; allocation-free after the first reserve).
- `render-game-prep` dense surface (`player_level = 0`) and deep
  (`player_level = 40`) benchmark groups (Slice 36 collapsed the original
  8/16/32 tilemap-group-count variants once that parameter stopped varying
  the fixture); unit tests cover window caps, player level transitions,
  per-band inclusion, and depth order.

Checklist:

- [x] Define `DenseLayerRenderWindow` policy (min/max level offset, hole/ceiling
      exception rules) and document it beside `submitStaticDenseGeometry`.
- [x] Replace demo-only `k_max_dense_submit_layers = 16` with window-derived cap
      (or explicit world-build budget) and fail loud at world build if exceeded.
- [x] Wire window into `submitStaticDenseGeometry` and
      `GameplayScene.player_level` / camera-level handoff.
- [x] Reserve renderer static-group high-water from window + sparse overhead.
- [x] Add `render-game-prep` bench cases at `player_level` 0 vs mid-depth;
      record `mergeDrawList` and submit cost (originally also varied at
      8/16/32 static tilemap groups; that axis was collapsed in Slice 36 once
      it stopped affecting the built fixture).
- [x] Add unit tests: surface window caps submit count; deep play submits only
      the near stack; depth order preserved within the window.
- [x] Profile GPU memory budget for target level count × world size; document
      ceiling in `WorldBuildConfig` or load-time gate.
- [ ] Optional: restore linear `mergeDrawList` after window sort guarantees
      static order.

Deferred (separate slice if window is insufficient):

- Chunk-aligned dense tilemap regions instead of one full-world quad per layer.
- Level-of-detail / clip planes for deep underground beyond the window.
- Tile-data buffer unload for layers far from play (residency policy).

Acceptance checks:

- [x] World build with ≥32 dense levels succeeds; surface play stays within the
      configured draw and submit budget.
- [x] Digging through a vertical stack at depth 0..N shows correct planes in the
      window; no 23A regressions (depth order, `cycle=false`).
- [x] `zig build bench -- --group render-game-prep` reports stable prep cost at
      configured window sizes.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.

Status: implemented and runtime-validated; window policy documented in
`docs/rendering-assets-shaders.md`. Optional linear `mergeDrawList` micro-opt
remains open.


## Slice 24: Scoped Simulation Tiers And Chunk Policy

Goal: turn the Slice 22 scaffolding into real scoped simulation behavior after
Slice 23 provides world/chunk/visibility inputs.

Readiness: the foundation for this slice is fully present (Slices 22/23/21);
what remains is wiring. The six checklist items below are the concrete gaps
between the current full-active pipeline and real scoped behavior.

> Historical pre-implementation assessment (2026-06-28, superseded by the
> **Status** below): at the time, `allowsMovement`/`allowsCollision`/
> `allowsCognition` were confirmed never consulted in `SimulationPipeline.update`,
> so every entity paid full pipeline cost every step regardless of tier. That gap
> is closed — see **Status** and **Implementation decisions** below for the
> landed `SimulationScopeSystem` gating.

Current foundation (present — do not rebuild):

- `SimulationTier` enum with capability predicates `allowsMovement`,
  `allowsCollision`, `allowsCognition` (`simulation_scope.zig`).
- Per-entity cold metadata `EntitySimulationMetadata { tier, chunk }` on
  `EntitySlot.simulation`, with `simulationMetadata`/`setSimulationMetadata`
  accessors and a `simulationScopeStatsFullActive()` tally (`data_system.zig`).
- `ActiveRegion` half-open chunk rectangle with `containsChunk()`, and
  `SimulationScope { active_region: ?ActiveRegion, stats }` plus per-tier and
  per-stage `SimulationScopeStats` (`simulation_scope.zig`).
- `WorldSystem` maintains `chunk_visible[]`, chunk coordinate columns, and
  `setVisibleChunksForWorldRect` / `chunkCoordForCell` (`world_system.zig`).
- (Pre-implementation state, now superseded by **Status** below) the pipeline
  used to run full-active unconditionally: `SimulationPipeline.update` built
  `SimulationScope.fullActive(...)` and dispatched every stage over the full
  component slices.

Status: implemented (2026-06-28). The backbone owner is
`SimulationScopeSystem` (`src/game/systems/simulation_scope.zig`), a pipeline-owned
system alongside movement/collision/ai/steering. It owns step/stagger state, the
scoped gathers, and the tier policy. Each O(N)-per-step pass threads like the other
processors and owns its own `AdaptiveWorkTuner`: the three gathers (movement,
collision, AI) are stream-compactions (per-range index buffers merged in scan
order), and the tier policy is a variable-output producer (per-range command
buffers merged into the frame's structural-command stream via the append protocol).
Threaded and serial produce identical results, and each pass exposes a `*Serial`
variant for the serial bench/test path.

Implementation decisions that diverged from the original sketch (code is
authoritative):

- Scope metadata moved off `EntitySlot` into **dense columns on the movement-body
  store** (`tier`, `chunk_x/y`, `stagger_phase`, `always_active`), in lockstep with
  the movement rows. The O(N)-per-step passes (chunk recompute, movement gather,
  tier policy) are aligned SoA scans/writes with no per-entity slot resolve. Scope
  metadata therefore exists exactly for entities with a movement body.
- Movement and collision gate on **tier only, no chunk filter** — off-screen
  entities keep moving and colliding. Their gathers short-circuit to full-active in
  O(1) via incremental `tier_counts` when no `dormant`/`kinematic` entity exists
  (the common frame), so the per-step scope cost scales with active scope.
- The cognition halo is derived from the **camera's visible chunks**
  (`WorldSystem.cognitionActiveRegion`), not a gameplay anchor position. AI gates
  on `cognition tier AND chunk-in-halo AND stagger phase`; scope pin metadata
  bypasses halo and stagger. With no visibility window yet, the gather falls back
  to full-active (no halo/stagger).
- **Steering is transitively scoped**: it acts only on the navigation intents AI
  emits, so gating AI gates steering without a second index list. Its avoidance
  spatial grid stays full so in-scope agents still avoid out-of-scope neighbors.
- **Simulation-LOD tier policy** (`collectChunkTierChanges`) assigns every entity
  the tier for its **cube (L∞) distance** from the **visible region**
  (`ActiveRegion.lodDistance` → `tierForChunkDistance`): `cognition` (≤
  `cognition_halo_chunks`) → `locomotion` (≤ `locomotion_halo_chunks`) → `kinematic`
  (≤ `kinematic_halo_chunks`) → `dormant` (beyond). So near entities think, far
  entities sleep — all four tiers are produced by distance, not just the cognition
  band. Scope pin metadata skips automatic tier demotion. It emits deferred
  `set_simulation_tier` structural commands appended to the frame stream for the
  state's commit seam (no tier mutation inside worker ranges), and reserves its
  command buffer up front so the per-step path is allocation-free even on a frame
  where many entities cross a band.
- **3D cube LOD (depth/level axis)**. The LOD volume is an L∞ ball over
  `(chunk_x, chunk_y, level)`, not a flat 2D ring: `ActiveRegion.lodDistance` takes
  the chebyshev chunk distance but floors it by a per-level penalty
  (`level_distance_chunks`, one band per level) against the region's `level` (set by
  the pipeline from the camera/player level). So an entity on a far depth/level
  reads as far regardless of its x/y and demotes out of cognition. The per-entity
  `level` rides as a dense scope column beside `tier`/`chunk_x/y`. Single-floor
  content defaults level to 0; the machinery supports multi-level worlds. The AI
  halo gate stays 2D (`containsChunk`); off-level entities are excluded purely
  through the tier the cube policy assigns them.

Checklist (done):

- [x] Public `WorldSystem.visibleChunkRegion()` and `cognitionActiveRegion(halo)`
      expose the camera chunks (+halo) as an `ActiveRegion`.
- [x] Entity chunk columns are derived in-pass by the movement processor from each
      integrated body's settled position (`movement.ChunkGridParams`), so there is no
      separate recompute pass; the scope gathers read the chunk columns movement wrote.
- [x] Scoped gather entry points for movement, collision, and AI (steering
      transitive). Processors keep their hot loops and take a `scope_dense_indices`
      option; null = full-active.
- [x] Per-entity `stagger_phase` (cold dense column) drives a 1-in-N cognition
      cadence inside the halo; skips counted in scope stats.
- [x] Tier promotions/demotions routed through deferred structural commands at the
      commit seam; no worker-range tier mutation.
- [x] Scope stats expose per-tier, per-stage, `stagger_skips`, and
      `chunk_filtered_entities` counts via `runtime_perf_log` and the demo state.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Scoped and full-active processor paths produce identical outputs for the same
      entity subset (gather index path mirrors the full path).
- [x] Tier/chunk filtering changes stage participation without changing stage order
      or `SimulationFrame` stream contracts.
- [x] Chunk metadata stays consistent with position after movement; scope counts
      match entities actually processed per stage.
- [x] Tier changes mutate `DataSystem` only through the deferred command commit.
- [x] `zig build test` covers gathers, tier gates, stagger, tier-command commit,
      and pipeline phase transitions without opening a window.
- [x] Debug stats report active scope counts so typical runs stay far below 50k
      stress scales by policy.

Known limitations / follow-up: see **Scaling Gaps And Hardening Frontier**
(simulation scale — movement contiguous-path vs scoped LOD).


## Slice 24B: Render Collect Hardening

**Status: landed.** All Checklist and Acceptance checks below are `[x]`.

Goal: harden dynamic entity render prep for scale — movement-index collect and
camera-only visibility gates — without conflating simulation LOD with render
policy or moving SDL_GPU submission into the pipeline.

Problem (observed at `render-game-prep` stress scales):

- `collectDynamicRecords` iterated `primitiveVisualSliceConst().entities` and
  called `renderEntityComponentIndices` per row — an `EntityId → slot` resolve on
  every visual even when chunk/AABB cull skipped append.
- An early draft gated render on `SimulationTier` (`allowsRender`), which blended
  sim LOD with draw policy. Render visibility must be camera-only; sim tier
  controls processor participation only.

Architecture notes:

- **Movement-body dense rows are the collect anchor.** Scope columns align on
  `movement_index`; a dense `has_primitive_visual` flag skips movement-only rows
  before slot resolve; `renderCollectIndicesForMovement` performs one slot read per
  chunk-pass row that carries a primitive visual. Scope columns are simulation
  inputs only — render collect does not read tier or pin metadata.
- **Render visibility is camera policy only.** `entityVisibleForRenderCollect`
  uses `WorldSystem.visibleChunkRegion()`; every drawable row then passes
  `VisibleWorldRect.overlapsAabb`. No render bypasses on scope metadata.
- **Dense floors are a separate axis.** In-window layers submit one full-world
  tilemap quad each (Slice 23B); GPU clips to the viewport. Per-entity depth
  cull (25E) is separate from the dense-floor window.

Checklist:

- [x] Add `RenderCollectIndices` and `renderCollectIndicesForMovement` on
      `DataSystem`.
- [x] Walk `movementBodySliceConst().entities` in `collectDynamicRecords`.
- [x] Camera-only `entityVisibleForRenderCollect` (chunk) + AABB for all entities.
- [x] Remove `SimulationTier.allowsRender`; sim tier does not gate draw.
- [x] Headless tests: sim tier does not affect collect; movement-index resolve.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] On-screen entities collect regardless of sim tier; off-screen entities
      (including player) skip before interpolation.
- [x] `zig build test` covers camera gates and movement-index collect helpers.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.

**Status: landed.** Render-scale follow-up without a new slice number is backlog
in **Scaling Gaps And Hardening Frontier** until promoted to a slice Checklist.


## Slice 25: Z-Aware Scalable Navigation Redesign

Goal: make the pathfinder correct, scalable, and functional for multi-Z-level,
fixed-but-variable-size worlds with event-driven dynamic tile changes and
mostly per-agent distinct goals. This supersedes the single-flat-grid,
goal-field-centric core from Slices 18/20 while keeping the frame-delayed
request/result contract and steering integration from Slices 18/19 intact.

Current foundation:

- Slice 18 frame-delayed pathfinding, Slice 19 steering/local avoidance, and
  Slice 20 bounded hard-path budgets define the request/result contract,
  deterministic deferral, and fixed-capacity caches this redesign keeps.
- Slice 21 typed events (`world_tile_changed`, `world_obstacle_changed`,
  `nav_region_invalidated`) are the dynamic-update signal source.
- Slice 23 world rendering provides `WorldSystem` levels (`addLevel`/
  `level_base_z`), dense render bands (`addDenseLayer`/`denseLayerCount`), sparse
  obstacles, `cellRect`, and tile size (32).
- Slice 22 `SimulationPipeline` owns the per-tick `pathfinding.update` call site
  and the one-time nav build; the per-stage `pipeline_pathfinding` timer exists.

Problem (observed defects this slice fixes):

- A Z-level is a `WorldSystem` level (floor), not a render band. `NavGrid`
  collapses every dense band of every level into one flat blocked mask
  (`pathfinding.zig` `markWorldObstacles`), which is wrong across bands and
  across floors. There is no inter-level connectivity.
- Whole-grid scratch sizing is the real scalability wall: goal fields and
  per-worker scratch are sized to total cell count, costing ~293 MB at 512²/32px
  before the demo coarsened to 128px nav cells. The 65,536-cell `goalFieldsEnabled`
  / `fallbackSearchEnabled` gates then silently degrade navigation to direct seek
  with no error — a correctness landmine.
- `PathQueryKey` includes the agent start cell, so a drifting agent mints a new
  key every cell, pending entries never dedup, and agents replan-storm (observed
  `replans=17256` in a 60s sample).
- Goal fields only build for ≥2 same-goal requests in the same step, so with
  per-agent distinct goals they never cache-hit (`field_cache_hits=0`,
  `fields_built=51`, `evictions=277`) — pure thrash and the source of the
  `pipeline_pathfinding_max≈31ms` dropped-frame spike.
- `update()` writes `deferred_requests` twice (`pathfinding.zig` ~1008 then
  ~1041); budget exhaustion can read as `unavailable` instead of `pending`.
- Coarse 128px cells push waypoints away from walls, raising `stuck`/`unavailable`.

Architecture notes:

- Navigable unit is the level (Z-floor). A level's per-cell blocked mask is the
  OR of that level's dense bands plus its sparse obstacles, exposed by a new
  `WorldSystem.levelBlocksMovement(level, x, y)` accessor so pathfinding stops
  iterating render bands directly.
- Two-tier (HPA*-style) structure per level: a fine per-level blocked bitset
  (cell = one 32px tile) plus a coarse chunk-portal graph (default 16-tile
  chunks). Inter-level travel uses explicit `LevelLink` records (ramp/stair/
  teleport) owned by `WorldSystem` as persistent world facts carrying only stable
  cell coordinates and level indices — never live nav indices or handles.
- A path query maps start/goal to `(level, cell)`, projects a blocked goal to the
  nearest open cell within a bounded radius, rejects cross-component goals via
  per-level connected components, then runs abstract A* over the portal graph plus
  link edges (Z-crossing is a link edge between portal nodes in different levels).
  The chosen corridor is then STITCHED into one obstacle-aware (level,cell) path by
  running per-segment local A* between consecutive corridor portals (a discrete jump
  only across a link edge) and cached whole; the per-agent query walks the path on its
  current level cell by cell, so multi-hop and cross-level routes converge with every
  heading a traversable neighbor. The `PathView` contract
  (`status`/`next_waypoint`/`path_len`) is unchanged.
- Per-agent A* uses a binary-heap open set and generation-stamped closed/g-cost
  storage sized to a bounded `max_explored_nodes` budget (e.g. 4096) via a
  cell→slot hash, not whole-grid arrays. Budget exhaustion returns `pending`
  (loud `path_budget_exhausted` counter), never silent `unavailable`.
- Cache/pending key is `{ nav_version, agent_class, goal_level, goal_cell }` —
  start is dropped. A cached result stores the abstract corridor; the per-entity
  waypoint is re-refined from the agent's current cell each step it is consumed,
  so a moving agent reuses one corridor for its whole trip and many agents sharing
  a goal share one pending entry.
- The core provides TWO coordinated solver modes. (1) Per-agent A* for distinct
  goals (the default). (2) A MANAGED shared-goal flow field for declared common
  goals (crowds converging on the player/an objective): a small fixed registry of
  reverse-Dijkstra integration fields keyed by `{nav_version, goal_cell}`,
  persistent and reused across frames and all agents, rebuilt only when nav
  changes or the declared goal crosses into a new nav cell, throttled by a minimum
  rebuild interval, and built under a per-frame expansion budget (a field may be
  `building` across frames) so it never spikes. This is NOT the old per-step
  auto-grouped goal field (which thrashed at `field_cache_hits=0`); grouping is
  declared by the request, not detected. Agents sample the field in O(1) and the
  result surfaces through the unchanged `PathView` contract. The long-range
  individual mechanism is the Slice 25C chunk-portal abstract tier; the group
  field is the shared-goal mechanism — both coexist.
- Dynamic updates are event-driven: `world_tile_changed`/`world_obstacle_changed`
  map to affected cells, flip blocked bits, mark owning (and border-touching
  neighbor) chunks dirty, and `applyNavUpdates` recomputes only dirty chunks'
  cells/portals/adjacency plus dirty-driven component relabel (full relabel only
  past a threshold, loud counter). One `nav_version` bump per batch invalidates
  goal-keyed cache/pending entries. The whole-world build runs only at init.
- The cell gates are deleted. Oversized worlds fail loud at construction via a
  configured `max_nav_memory_bytes` (`error.NavWorldTooLarge` with a diagnostic),
  not at query time. Per-query work is bounded by the abstract graph plus the node
  budget, independent of total world cell count.
- Threading: per-request abstract+local A* runs on workers with worker-indexed
  scratch and deterministic per-`pending_index` output (existing fallback
  dispatch shape); small batches stay inline via the adaptive tuner.
  `applyNavUpdates` runs single-threaded at the event reaction point before the
  next step's solves; chunk recompute is parallelizable later if needed.

Capacity/memory model (per level: W·H nav cells = C, L levels, K-cell chunks):
nav ≈ `L·(C/8 bitset + 4·C components) + links·16`. The per-worker local A* scratch
is now generation-stamped DIRECT per-cell arrays (g-cost + parent + stamp + closed
≈ 13 B/cell), so A* scratch ≈ `slots · C · 13 B` — O(cells) instead of
O(`max_explored_nodes`). This is a deliberate speed-for-bounded-memory trade (O(1)
node access, no hash probes); slots = `worker_participant_count` (workers+1, sized at
the build), and the build-time `max_nav_memory_bytes` gate counts exactly that
resident scratch, so a large world that exceeds the budget fails loud at the gate. `max_explored_nodes` remains the per-solve node BUDGET (a spill cap), enforced
by an explicit expansion counter rather than a hash-table-full condition.
`components` width (u32→u16 or abstract-graph-only reachability) is a
future memory lever for very large worlds.

Sub-slices (each independently shippable and headless-testable):

- Slice 25A — `WorldSystem` per-level navigability accessor + `LevelLink` store;
  pathfinding consumes `levelBlocksMovement` for level 0 only (behavior-preserving
  for the single-level demo).
- Slice 25B — hybrid core: per-agent A* (goal-keyed corridor cache, budgeted
  scratch) PLUS a managed shared-goal flow-field registry. Remove the old
  auto-grouped goal fields, cell gates, and the start-cell key; add
  `max_explored_nodes`, `max_group_fields`, group rebuild throttle/budget, and
  `max_nav_memory_bytes`; fix the `deferred_requests` double-write; redefine
  `unavailable` vs `pending`; request contract carries individual-vs-group kind.
- Slice 25C — chunk-portal abstract tier and cross-level query; `PathRequest`/
  `NavigationIntent` gain `start_level`/`goal_level`; steering fills them.
- Slice 25D — event-driven incremental rebuild: dirty nav-cell set, `applyNavUpdates`,
  per-affected-level mask/component recompute, single `nav_version` bump, nav-update
  metrics; wire world-tile/obstacle events from the post-commit reaction point into the
  pipeline instead of full rebuilds. Granularity: per-AFFECTED-LEVEL recompute (the
  bounded fallback the brief permits) — only affected levels' masks/components are
  re-derived and the shared chunk-portal abstract graph is rebuilt once (bounded by
  chunk borders, not cells); true per-chunk portal/CSR surgery would require a
  per-chunk-addressable portal store (a larger redesign) and is deferred. A relabel of
  every level happens only past a configured affected-level threshold and increments a
  loud `nav_full_relabel` counter; unaffected levels are never touched and the
  whole-world build stays init-only.

Checklist:

- [x] 25A: add `WorldSystem.levelBlocksMovement`, `levelCount`, and `LevelLink`
      store/accessors; switch `markWorldObstacles` to per-level composition.
- [x] 25B: per-agent A* (budgeted scratch, goal-keyed corridor cache, no
      start-cell key); delete the old auto-grouped goal fields, cell gates, and
      their stats; add memory-gate validation; fix the `deferred_requests`
      single-write. Heap A* is now the sole individual solver; scratch is sized
      to `max_explored_nodes` via a cell->slot hash, not whole-grid arrays; the
      node-budget spill returns `pending` and increments `path_budget_exhausted`.
- [x] 25B: managed shared-goal flow-field registry (`max_group_fields`,
      cell-quantized + throttled + per-frame-budgeted rebuilds, declared by
      request kind, sampled O(1) through `PathView`); both modes tested. Group
      fields are built only on declared `group` requests (zero cost when unused),
      throttled by `group_field_rebuild_min_steps`, and built across frames under
      `group_field_build_budget`.
- [x] 25C: build per-level chunk-portal graph; abstract A* over portals + link
      edges; stitch the chosen corridor into one full obstacle-aware (level,cell) path
      via per-segment local A* (link edges are discrete jumps) and walk it per-agent on
      its current level cell by cell; add level fields to request/intent/steering.
      Abstract scratch saturation or a per-segment node-budget spill returns
      `budget_exhausted` (retry), reserving `unavailable` for a missing corridor.
      Abstract seeding scans only the start level's portals via a per-level portal
      index, so per-query work is bounded independent of total cells and of other
      levels' portals. (Performance, post-25: the per-level index is further grouped
      by connected component — a per-(level,component) CSR — so seeding scans only the
      START component's portals, not the level's full border; architecture unchanged.)
- [x] 25D: incremental nav rebuild driven by typed world events. `applyNavUpdates`
      flips the affected level's blocked bits, recomputes only affected levels'
      masks/components, rebuilds the chunk-portal abstract graph once, and bumps
      `nav_version` once per batch so goal-keyed cache/pending/group entries re-solve.
      `GameDemoState` collects blocking `world_tile_changed`/`world_obstacle_changed`
      (and entity-driven obstacle) changes into a pre-reserved dirty nav-cell set and
      feeds `pipeline.applyNavUpdates`; the whole-world build path is init-only. Added
      `nav_dirty_chunks`, `nav_incremental_rebuilds`, `nav_full_relabel`,
      `nav_version_bumps` metrics; the per-affected-level relabel degenerates to a
      counted full relabel only past `nav_full_relabel_level_threshold`. The build
      helpers were moved off per-call `allocator.alloc` onto persistent scratch, and
      the abstract-graph buffers grow to their real size at the init rebuild and
      retain that high-water capacity, so an incremental rebuild within the
      high-water mark allocates nothing (a failing-allocator test drives both the
      system and graph allocators across a block-then-reopen). A genuine topology
      expansion past the high-water mark does one bounded amortized growth — a cold,
      event-triggered path covered by a separate test. The `max_nav_memory_bytes`
      gate estimates nav memory from realistic structure (portals bounded by
      chunk-border cells, CSR edges by portal count times a small abstract degree),
      not a per-chunk pairwise worst case, so large sparse worlds build. `PathView`
      and request contracts are unchanged.
- [x] Reset the demo `nav_cell_size` stopgap (currently 128) to a tile-aligned
      principled value (32 = one nav cell per tile); coarseness lives in the chunk
      tier, not the cell size.
- [x] Keep pathfinding a gameplay system in `src/game/systems/`; no test-only
      enum tags, marker fields, or fixture hooks in production contracts.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Intra-level paths are correct against a per-level composed mask; a blocked
      goal projects to the nearest open cell (`path_goal_projected`); disconnected
      goals return `unavailable` exactly once and cache.
- [x] Cross-level `LevelLink` traversal works (25C): a bidirectional link routes an
      off-level agent across floors (`cross_level_solves`); a directed link works one
      way only; a missing or blocked-endpoint link returns `unavailable` (not a
      permanent stall); per-level obstacles do not bleed across floors; a multi-hop
      same-level corridor (split component bridged by a same-level teleport) and a
      cross-level corridor both travel obstacle-free past a concave wall in single-cell
      steps (no straight-line cut) and reach the goal; abstract scratch saturation
      reads pending (not cached unavailable); a warmed abstract solve does not
      allocate; a cross-level group member falls back to an individual corridor once
      the goal-level field is ready. All asserted by headless tests.
- [x] A moving agent toward a fixed goal produces one accepted request then cache
      reuse (no per-cell churn): asserted by the goal-keyed dedup-under-drift test.
- [x] Per-query explored-node count is bounded (`max_explored_nodes`) and
      independent of total world cell count; spills return `pending`.
- [x] An oversized world returns `error.NavWorldTooLarge` at construction; no query
      path ever silently degrades to direct seek (the cell gates were removed).
- [x] A tile/obstacle event blocks/unblocks a corridor and the next path reflects
      it; `nav_incremental_rebuilds`/`nav_version_bumps` are non-zero and full
      rebuild runs only at init. (Slice 25D.) Headless tests cover: flipping a
      corridor gap to blocking reroutes the next solve through a different gap (and
      stale cached path invalidates because its `nav_version` key no longer matches);
      closing the last gap returns `unavailable`; unblocking a tile opens a shorter
      path; an edit on level 0 leaves a second level's mask/components byte-for-byte
      untouched (work scales with the dirty set, not world size); an empty batch is a
      no-op; and the steady-path update is allocation-free under a failing allocator.
- [x] `zig build fmt`, `zig build check`, `zig build test`, `zig build verify`, and
      targeted pathfinding benchmarks pass.

Open decisions (recommendation in parentheses): inter-level link representation
(explicit `LevelLink` records, not inferred tile flags); chunk size (16 tiles);
shared-goal flow field is folded into the 25B core (declared by request kind,
persistent, cell-quantized + throttled + budgeted), not opportunistically grouped;
parallel-solve threshold (keep existing adaptive/inline behavior; `applyNavUpdates`
serial initially); `components` width (u32 initially); goal-level source
(`NavigationIntent`, default 0 until multi-level gameplay exists).

Status: 25A, 25B, 25C, and 25D implemented. The hybrid core ships goal-keyed individual
A* with budget-bounded scratch, the managed shared-goal flow-field registry, and the
chunk-portal abstract tier with cross-level `LevelLink` routing. Long-range and
cross-level queries route through abstract A* over portal/link nodes, then stitch the
chosen corridor into one full obstacle-aware (level,cell) path via per-segment local
A* (link edges are discrete jumps) and cache it whole; the per-agent query walks it on
its current level cell by cell, so every heading is a traversable neighbor. Abstract
seeding scans only the start level's portals (per-level portal index); abstract scratch
saturation or a per-segment node-budget spill returns `budget_exhausted` (retry) rather
than a hard negative. The old auto-grouped goal fields, cell gates, start-cell key, and
their stats remain removed; `deferred_requests` is a single post-compaction write in
both update paths; the memory gate fails loud at rebuild. 25D (event-driven incremental
rebuild) is implemented: `applyNavUpdates` folds a dirty nav-cell set from world-tile/
obstacle events, plus entity-driven obstacle events (`component_changed`/
`entity_destroyed`) resolved to a localized nav-cell span via the changed entity's
world-space collision rect, into the existing graph by remasking + patching only the
chunks the dirty cells/spans touch, rebuilding the chunk-portal abstract graph once, and
bumping `nav_version` once per batch so goal-keyed work re-solves; the whole-world build
runs only at init. A whole-level remask (recomputing every chunk on the affected level)
is a bounded fallback for the rare case an entity change carries no resolvable rect, not
the normal path; a full relabel of every level happens only past a configured
affected-level threshold, counted via `nav_full_relabel`. True per-chunk portal/CSR
surgery is deferred pending a per-chunk-addressable portal store. Route the slice diff to
review with attention to the goal-keyed cache reuse and corridor-advancement contracts,
the per-affected-chunk update scope, and the allocation-free steady-path claim.

Post-25 performance pass (architecture unchanged — same A* results, deterministic,
allocation-free on the warmed path; all layers retained): (1) the per-worker local A*
scratch is generation-stamped DIRECT per-cell arrays indexed by cell index, giving
O(1) node access with no hash probes/collisions in place of the prior open-addressed
cell→slot hash. Per-worker scratch is now O(cells); the build-time memory gate
(`NavMemoryBudget.requiredBytes`) counts `slots · cells · 13 B`, and `max_explored_nodes`
remains the per-solve node budget enforced by an explicit expansion counter.
(2) Abstract seeding is component-scoped: the per-level portal index is grouped by
connected component (a per-(level,component) CSR), so seeding scans only the start
component's portals rather than the level's full border. (3) `localAStar` derives each
neighbor's (x,y) incrementally from the current cell plus the direction offset and feeds
those coordinates straight to the octile heuristic, removing per-neighbor `index%width`/
`index/width` div/mod. A node-access design that would make a same-component
budget-spill escalate to the abstract corridor (the considered "WIN C") was NOT adopted:
with component-scoped seeding the abstract corridor for a same-component goal collapses
to a single portal, so escalation cannot subdivide the long segment and would only add
per-frame work — making it effective would require start-chunk-scoped seeding (a global
corridor-shape change), a design decision left for a future slice. (4) Entity-driven
static-obstacle changes (an entity destroyed or its `movement_body`/`collision_bounds`/
`collision_response` changed) now localize the same way tile edits already did: the
structural-commit event carries the entity's world-space collision rect (before and/or
after the change), `PathfindingSystem.markNavObstacleRectDirty` resolves it to a nav-cell
span, and the incremental update patches only the chunks that span touches. The prior
25D behavior — treating every entity-driven obstacle change as whole-level dirty,
remasking and re-flooding every chunk on level 0 — is now only the defensive fallback for
the case a change carries no resolvable rect (`markNavLevelDirty`/
`markNavLevelDirtyWithFallbackWarn`, logged at `warn`); it should not occur in practice
since every static-obstacle-eligible entity has the movement_body + collision_bounds a
rect needs.

Deferred follow-up: per-entity depth alignment across sim, navigation, and
render is tracked as Slice 25E below and under **Scaling Gaps And Hardening
Frontier** (simulation scale). The nav substrate is in place; the gap is entity
level column wiring in `DataSystem`, steering, path views, and render cull.


## Slice 25E: Per-Entity NPC Level And Autonomous Z-Traversal

**Status: landed**, with one superseded item. All Checklist and Acceptance
checks below are `[x]` for the record, but `PathView.next_cell_level`
(checklist items below referencing it) was later found to have zero
production consumers — `steering.zig`'s `directionFromPathStatus`, the only
real caller of `statusForWorld`/`statusForKeyAndStart`, never read it — and was
removed as dead code. The actual NPC level-transition mechanism is, and always
was, `DigController.applyEntityPlaneTraversal` (invoked from
`SimulationPipeline.applyNpcPlaneTraversal`), which drives transitions from the
entity's real physical-cell world geometry with no lag/latency gap. See
`docs/coding-standards.md`/project convention: code is authoritative for doc
drift, so this note replaces the earlier "landed" claim for the
`next_cell_level` field specifically; the rest of the slice (per-entity level
column, steering `start_level` sourcing, render cull by entity level) is
unaffected and still landed as described.

Goal: give each NPC entity its own Z-level so it can request cross-level paths,
traverse ramps and stairs autonomously, and be culled to its own floor instead
of always rendering on the player's level.

Prerequisite context: Slice 23B scales **dense floor** submission (~120 layers);
this slice scales **entity** level columns and NPC draw cull. Player floor
policy (`GameplayScene.player_level` → `submitStaticDenseGeometry`) stays in
23B; NPCs need their own level column and render-prep filter here.

Current foundation:

- Slice 25 provides a fully correct two-tier nav substrate with `LevelLink`
  records and cross-level A* corridor stitching.
- `PathRequest`/`NavigationIntent` already carry `start_level`/`goal_level`
  fields (added in 25C); steering hardcodes `start_level = 0`.
- The per-level portal graph, `PathView`, and link-edge traversal are complete.

Problem (confirmed silent-behavior gap):

- `steering.zig` `writePathRequests` hardcodes `start_level = 0` and
  `statusForEntityWorld(..., 0, ...)` ignores the entity's actual floor.
- `PathView` exposes `next_waypoint` XY but no level; an agent crossing a link
  cannot detect the level transition and update its own Z.
- Ramp/fall plane-traversal logic is player-only (`game_demo_state.zig`).
- NPCs are drawn at their XY on whatever level the player occupies, so an NPC
  pursuing the player underground appears to teleport along its level-0 path.
  This produces wrong-but-non-crashing behavior that attributes to AI logic,
  not a routing defect.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a per-entity level (Z) column to `DataSystem` (cold metadata, default
      surface level `0`), following the component-store pattern; initialize in
      `createEntity`.
- [x] Steering sources `start_level` from the entity's level column rather than
      the hardcoded `0`.
- [x] Extend `PathView` to expose `next_cell_level` alongside `next_waypoint`
      so an agent can detect a link crossing and commit a level update. (Later
      removed: no production consumer ever read this field — see status note
      above.)
- [x] Update the per-step movement/traversal pass to apply NPC level transitions
      at link cells (mirroring the player ramp/fall logic); update the entity
      level column through an explicit main-thread commit, not inside worker
      ranges. (Landed via `DigController.applyEntityPlaneTraversal` driven by
      physical-cell world geometry, not via the removed `next_cell_level`.)
- [x] Render and cull each NPC on its own level, not the player's.
- [x] Add tests covering same-level NPC pathing (no regression), cross-level
      pathfinding, and NPC render cull matching entity level. (The
      `next_cell_level`-specific assertions were removed alongside the field;
      the remaining status/waypoint/render-cull assertions still cover this.)
- [x] Demo stress: procedural world `addUndergroundLevelStack(31)` (32 levels),
      32 movers, GPU budget gate, scaled pipeline reserves.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Cross-level path queries route through link cells correctly (pathfinding
      + caches tests); NPC traversal commits `world_level` on ramp/fall cell
      entry via `DigController.applyEntityPlaneTraversal`, not via
      `next_cell_level` (removed — see status note above).
- [x] Intra-level NPC behavior is unchanged (steering parity tests).
- [x] NPCs are culled to their own level, not the player's (`render_prep` test).
- [x] No steady-state allocation on hot paths.
- [x] `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and `zig build verify` pass.


## Slice 26: Entity Faction And Classification Model

**Status: landed.** All Checklist and Acceptance checks below are `[x]`.

Goal: give entities a classification so perception and behavior can distinguish
threat / ally / neutral. No team or faction concept exists anywhere today; it is
a hard prerequisite for perception (Slice 29) and behavior arbitration
(Slice 32).

Current foundation:

- Entities are dense SoA with stable `EntityId` handles and component masks
  (`data_system.zig`); the component-store pattern is established (e.g.
  `AiAgentStore`).
- No faction, team, allegiance, or relationship data exists.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a `Faction` component (`src/game/faction.zig`): a small enum
      faction id per entity, following the full component-store pattern.
- [x] Add a fixed faction-relationship matrix (enum × enum → stance:
      hostile / neutral / friendly), const-evaluated, scalar/enum only, no
      per-frame allocation and no hash lookup on hot paths.
- [x] Expose a stance query usable from processor hot paths (`stance(a, b)`)
      that compiles to a table index, not a map lookup.
- [x] Add to `EntityTemplate` and demo spawns so actors can be tagged.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Stance lookups are allocation-free and branch-light on hot paths.
- [x] Faction assignment round-trips through structural commands and survives
      entity destruction/reuse with generational correctness.
- [x] `zig build test` covers stance symmetry/asymmetry and template wiring.


## Slice 27: Deterministic Per-Entity RNG Facility

**Status: landed.** All Checklist and Acceptance checks below are `[x]`.

Goal: provide reproducible randomness for AI (wander jitter, appraisal noise,
investigate targets) that does not break the determinism contract
(serial == threaded, replayable, range-order-independent).

Current foundation:

- `src/core` owns shared math/SIMD/logging helpers but has no deterministic RNG
  facility; existing wander randomness is ad hoc.
- The fixed-step loop provides a stable per-step index usable as an RNG input.

Architecture notes:

- A counter-based / hash-based stream (e.g. `hash(entity_index, step, salt)`) is
  required rather than a stateful PRNG, so a worker can derive an entity's noise
  independent of range partitioning or execution order.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a stateless, seeded, splittable RNG in `src/core` keyed by
      `(entity_index, step, salt)` returning uniform f32 / bounded ints.
- [x] Document the determinism guarantee: same inputs → same outputs regardless
      of thread count or range order.
- [x] Migrate existing AI wander randomness onto it as the first consumer.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Identical RNG outputs across serial and threaded runs for the same step.
- [x] No per-call allocation; no shared mutable RNG state across workers.
- [x] `zig build test` covers reproducibility and distribution bounds.

`src/core/rng.zig` adds `mix64`/`uniformF32`/`boundedU32`/`unitVec2`, generalizing
the splitmix64-style mixer that was previously a private, non-reusable helper
inside `ai.zig`. The migration also fixed a real bug, not just a refactor: the
old call was keyed only by a hardcoded seed and the entity's dense index, both
constant over time, so wander direction never resampled. `SimulationScopeSystem`
now exposes `currentStep()`, `SimulationPipeline` threads it into `AiConfig.step`
each fixed step, and `ai.zig`'s `decideDir` keys its wander draw off
`(seed, entity_index, step, wander_rng_salt)` so direction actually varies over
time while staying deterministic for a fixed step and identical across serial
and threaded runs. A first landing resampled on every AI-active step, which
review caught as trading the "never varies" bug for a "zero continuity" one
(uncorrelated direction every tick reads as jitter, not wandering). Fixed by
quantizing `step` into coarser epochs (`AiConfig.wander_resample_period_steps`,
default 300 steps / 5s at 60Hz) before hashing, so direction holds steady for a
stretch and then jumps to a new per-entity-distinct heading.


## Slice 28: Shared Spatial Index Service

**Status: landed.** All Checklist and Acceptance checks below are `[x]`.

Goal: build one frame-level spatial index consumed by AI separation and
perception instead of each system building its own grid.

Current foundation:

- AI separation built a deterministic 32-unit grid each step
  (`systems/ai.zig`); Perception (Slice 29) would have added a second.

**Deviation from the original checklist wording:** the original draft asked to
port "AI separation *and collision broadphase*" onto one shared grid. Collision
broadphase does not actually build a grid — it runs sweep-and-prune (SAP) on a
`min_x`-sorted `order` array (`src/game/systems/collision.zig`), with a warm
incremental insertion-sort (`sortWarm`/`full_sort_disorder_percent`) that
exploits frame-to-frame temporal coherence, plus SIMD Y-overlap filtering.
That is a different, already-tuned algorithm, not a duplicate grid build.
Forcing collision onto a per-step-rebuilt uniform grid would risk regressing
that incremental-sort win and would require reproducing SAP's exact
candidate-pair order to satisfy this slice's own parity gate. **Decision: build
the shared index for AI separation (this slice) and Perception (Slice 29, the
actual driver). Collision stays on SAP, untouched.**

Architecture notes:

- Built once per fixed step by the pipeline-owned `SpatialIndexSystem`
  (`src/game/systems/spatial_index.zig`), from the same cognition-scoped
  population `AiSystem` already gathers (`scope_dense_indices`); workers read
  the resulting `SpatialIndexView` immutably. AI separation's ported output
  matches the pre-refactor per-step grid exactly (parity-tested, including an
  O(n²) brute-force bit-for-bit proof plus a second cross-cell oracle that
  independently reconstructs the cell_y-outer/cell_x-inner/ascending-index
  traversal spec, since float-summation order only becomes observable once a
  population spans multiple cells), not just approximately.

Checklist:

- [x] Add a frame-built spatial hash/grid owned at the pipeline boundary, sized
      from reserved capacity, rebuilt per step, read-only to workers.
- [x] Port AI separation to consume it; remove the duplicate grid build.
      Collision keeps its own tuned SAP broadphase by design (see the
      Deviation note above) — porting it is a future benchmarked-optional item,
      not this slice's requirement.
- [x] Expose a bounded neighbor-query API (max samples / radius) reusable by
      perception.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Separation outputs are identical to the pre-refactor results (parity
      tests, including a single-cell brute-force bit-for-bit proof and a
      multi-cell cross-cell-order oracle proof).
- [x] Index build and queries are allocation-free after warmup and deterministic
      (serial == threaded).
- [x] `zig build bench` shows no regression from removing the redundant grid
      build — the `ai` group's timed window now excludes the build (its own
      `spatial_index` bench group times that separately), so per-step
      `separation_checks` are unchanged and measured throughput improved.


## Slice 29: AI Perception Substrate

**Status: landed** — vision (including the LOS cost-risk fix) and hearing are
both in place. `AiPerception` (`data_system/perception.zig`), `PerceptionSystem`
(`systems/perception.zig`), the `entity_perceived`/`entity_lost` event
contract, and the `perception`/`perception-los-dense` benchmark groups are all
in place with full test coverage: range/FOV/LOS gating, faction-stance
gating, same-level gating, player-as-candidate, all four transition shapes
(acquire/lose/hold/identity-swap), the per-step event cap with drop
diagnostics, serial/threaded parity, and a `FailingAllocator` steady-state
allocation-free proof. The squared-form FOV test
(`dot(facing, to) > 0 AND dot^2 > cos_half_fov^2 * dist2`) turned out not to
need the vector sin/cos polynomial Slice 34 deferred here — no production
caller for `simd.sinFloat4`/`cosFloat4`/`sinCosFloat4` was added, since a
unit-length facing vector makes the squared dot-product compare exact without
any per-frame trig.

**Hearing (closes this slice):** `AiPerception` gained a cold `hearing_range`
tunable and hot `heard_stimulus`/`heard_stimulus_x/y` columns
(`data_system/types.zig`, `data_system/perception.zig`), following the same
cold/hot split and `PerceptionStore.set`-preserves-hot-columns contract as
vision. `SimulationFrame` gained `stimuli: RangeOutputStream(WorldStimulus)`
(`simulation.zig`) — a transient per-step positional buffer
(`position`/`intensity`/`kind`/`level`, scalar-only), cleared every
`beginStep` and never promoted to a `SimulationEvent`, since it carries no
stable entity identity to transition against (only state *transitions*
become events, per the track-wide contract above). `intensity` is stored but
unused until a second producer exists to calibrate a falloff curve.
`DigController.process` is the sole producer today (`dig_controller.zig`),
appending one stimulus alongside its existing `world_tile_changed` event; its
sibling `carveLandingCell` (the fall/landing path) deliberately does not,
since it runs after `PerceptionSystem.update` in the same fixed step and
would be cleared before any hearing pass could read it — documented in place
rather than silently wired up wrong. Hearing is folded into
`PerceptionSystem.computeOneAgent` as a squared-distance range check gated by
same-level only (no FOV, no faction-stance gate — a stimulus is positional
and factionless), reading `frame.stimuli.mergedItems()` through a
`PerceptionConfig.stimuli` field. The stream itself needs no reserve call
from any owning module: its per-step count is a fixed producer invariant (at
most one, from `dig.process`), not scene-scale-dependent, so it grows lazily
on first use exactly like `PerceptionSystem`'s own gather buffers already do.
Tests cover range/level gating, nearest-of-multiple selection, hot-column
round-trip and preservation-on-retune, serial/threaded parity, and
`FailingAllocator` allocation-free proofs alongside vision's existing
coverage.

**LOS cost-risk fix (`hasLineOfSight`'s per-sample lookup is now O(1)):** this
slice originally shipped with `hasLineOfSight` calling
`WorldSystem.levelBlocksMovement` once per raycast sample, which linearly
rescans every sparse tile in the world on every call. `src/benchmarks/perception.zig`'s
`perception`/`perception-los-dense` groups proved this was a real hazard, not
theoretical: identical `sensed_count`/`los_checks`/`los_blocked`/
`nearest_threat_found_count` between the two fixtures, but the `-dense`
fixture (20,000 extra sparse tiles placed far outside any agent's path) paid
a 6.5x–10x wall-clock penalty purely from world-wide tile-count bulk.

The fix adds `PerceptionSystem.level_blocked`: a per-level, raw-world-tile-
granularity blocked bitmap (`LevelBlockedSlot`), built at most once per
distinct observer level per step by `ensureLevelBlockedCachesForObservers`/
`ensureLevelBlockedCache` (mirrors `pathfinding/nav_grid.zig`'s
`markWorldObstacles` shape — dense-band scan + sparse-tiles-filtered-to-level
pass — but with no nav-cell rect rasterization, since this bitmap is
tile-indexed 1:1). The build runs on the main thread before any range job is
dispatched; every worker range only ever reads the completed, per-step-stable
snapshot. `hasLineOfSight` now calls `lookupLevelBlocked` (an O(1) bitmap
read) per sample instead of `levelBlocksMovement`.

This slice deliberately did **not** reuse `pathfinding/nav_grid.zig`'s
already-resident, incrementally-maintained `NavGrid` (via
`NavGraph.grid(level)`), even though that would avoid a second structure.
Two independent findings ruled it out: (1) `NavGrid.blocked` is a strict
*superset* of `levelBlocksMovement`'s contract — it composes world obstacles
**OR** (on level 0 only) `DataSystem` static collision bodies
(`NavGrid.markStaticBodies`), so reusing it would silently occlude LOS behind
entities that `levelBlocksMovement` never blocks on, failing the parity test
by construction on any fixture with a level-0 static body not coincident with
a world tile; and (2) `NavGrid.cell_size` (32, set explicitly at
`rebuildStaticNavGrid`/`rebuildStaticNavGridWithWorld` call sites, e.g.
`game_demo_state.zig`'s `nav_cell_size = 32`) equals `WorldSystem.tile_size`
(also enforced to 32 at asset load, `world_tileset_meta.zig`'s
`required_tile_size`) only *incidentally* — two independently-set literals,
not an invariant enforced by an assert or a shared constant — so reuse would
also risk a silent LOS-granularity change if that ever drifted.
`NavGraph.grid(level)` is additionally nullable and only covers levels
pathfinding has actually built, which observers are not guaranteed to be
confined to. `PerceptionSystem` therefore owns its own cache, matching
`levelBlocksMovement`'s exact contract with zero cross-grid coordinate or
occlusion-set risk, proven by a dedicated parity test
(dense-blocked/sparse-blocked/open/out-of-range-level/out-of-range-cell, all
compared directly against `levelBlocksMovement`). The cache originally
rebuilt fully every step for every level touched that step (no
nav-invalidation-event-driven cross-step reuse) — a deliberate scope decision
at the time, not an oversight; see the residual note below, and the
incremental dirty-tracking fix that later replaced this (superseding the
residual note) further down this section.

Before/after (`--profile quick`, same methodology as this slice's original
risk-confirmation run), 10,000 agents, serial-direct: `perception` 33.60ms →
21.98ms; `perception-los-dense` 217.58ms → 25.74ms (was a 6.5x regression,
now 1.17x). Best-threaded case, 10,000 agents: `perception` ~6.24ms → 6.39ms
(unchanged, within run-to-run noise); `perception-los-dense` 25.81ms (over the
16.67ms/60Hz budget) → 9.64ms (`thread-small-range`, well under budget). Full
8-case tables at 1,024/4,096/10,000 agents for both groups are in this
change's PR/session record.

**Honest residual, not rounded away:** the two groups do not fully converge.
A fixed, non-scaling gap remains — measured best-case-threaded: ~2.99ms
(1,024 agents), ~2.89ms (4,096), ~3.25ms (10,000); serial-direct: ~2.63ms,
~3.27ms, ~3.76ms respectively. This gap is flat across a ~10x population
range (not proportional to agent count or `los_checks`, which are identical
between the two fixtures at every scale), which is itself the evidence the
per-sample lookup is genuinely O(1): the residual is entirely the once-per-step
cache-rebuild cost (a single O(world sparse-tile count) pass over the
`-dense` fixture's 20,000 extra tiles, paid once per step regardless of how
many agents or LOS samples run that step), not a per-sample or per-agent cost.
The realistic `perception` fixture shows no regression at all. Cross-step
caching (invalidating the bitmap only on an actual world-tile change, the same
way `PathfindingSystem` already reacts to nav-invalidation events) would
close this residual entirely but was deliberately deferred at the time — it
would touch the nav-invalidation event contract for a gap that only appears
in a fixture engineered specifically to be an unrealistic sparse-tile-density
torture test, not in any representative world density this project's other
benchmarks use. **This deferral is now superseded** — see "Incremental
dirty-tracked LOS-blocked cache" below, which implements exactly this and
closes the residual.

**Shared per-level sparse-tile index (root-cause fix behind the residual):**
after the LOS cost-risk fix above, a review pass found the *same*
scan-every-sparse-tile-then-filter-by-level pattern independently duplicated
in three places: `WorldSystem.levelBlocksMovement`, `NavGrid.markWorldObstacles`,
and `PerceptionSystem.ensureLevelBlockedCache` (added by this slice). Each
walked every `SparseTileRow` in the world checking `level_index` per tile,
even though a `SparseTileRow`'s level is fixed at insertion and never changes.
`WorldSystem` now carries a reverse per-level index —
`sparse_level_tiles: std.ArrayList(std.ArrayList(u32))`, one growable bucket of
`sparse_tiles` indices per level, plus the accessor
`sparseTileIndicesForLevel(level_index) []const u32` — maintained *eagerly*
inside `addSparseTile` (the sole inserter; tiles are never removed and never
reassigned to another level, confirmed by inspection) rather than lazily
rebuilt off a dirty flag. Eager maintenance was a deliberate deviation from
the `sparse_render_order`/`sparse_depth_ranges` render-index pattern this was
modeled after: that pattern's flat sorted-array-plus-ranges shape only stays
correct if rebuilt in full on every structural change, and `render_index_dirty`
is safely deferred only because its sole reader (`ensureRenderDepthIndex`) runs
once per render frame. `levelBlocksMovement`, `NavGrid.markWorldObstacles`, and
`PerceptionSystem.ensureLevelBlockedCache` do not have that luxury — they run
inside the fixed-step gameplay tick (nav reacting to a dig, perception
rebuilding its bitmap) and can be reached in the same step a sparse tile is
placed, before any render pass would run; a lazily-rebuilt index keyed off a
render-only dirty flag would have been stale for them. `sparse_level_tiles`
also cannot itself be shaped like `sparse_render_order` for the same reason:
keeping one level's run contiguous in a single flat array only works with a
full resort after every insert, which is exactly the O(n) rescan this index
exists to remove. All three consumers now iterate
`sparseTileIndicesForLevel(level)` instead of the whole `sparse_tiles` set.
Proof: a new `sparseTileIndicesForLevel` exact-set test (multiple levels,
interleaved insertion order, a level with zero sparse tiles, and an
out-of-range level) and a new `levelBlocksMovement` multi-level parity test
placing an obstacle on one level at a cell shared with two other levels
(`world_system.zig`); the existing `nav_graph.zig` incremental-update tests
(which compare `NavGrid`'s composed mask directly against
`levelBlocksMovement` cell-by-cell across every level of a multi-level demo
world) continued to pass unchanged, since the contract did not move, only the
scan did.

Measured effect on the `perception`/`perception-los-dense` gap (`--profile
quick`, same methodology as the numbers above): the `-dense` fixture's extra
20,000 sparse tiles all land on the *same single level* as the populated
region (`WorldSystem.initDemoFromMeta` never adds a second level), so this
fixture cannot exercise the index's intended cross-level win — the
scan-avoidance the three consumers now get on a genuinely multi-level world
(e.g. the underground stack `nav_graph.zig`'s tests build) does not apply
here. What the per-level index *did* remove from this single-level scan was
the redundant per-tile `sparseTileLevel(idx)` accessor call and its
`MultiArrayList.items(.level_index)` re-derivation on every one of the 20,000
tiles, replaced by one hoisted slice read up front. An isolated, same-session
A/B on identical 20,002-tile single-level data (30 back-to-back reps,
`world_system.zig`, removed after measurement) showed this specific loop drop
from ~784us/rebuild (old scan-and-filter) to ~45us/rebuild (new indexed
scan) — a ~17x reduction in the loop itself, with zero behavior change (both
loops agree on the blocked-tile count every rep).

At the full pipeline level, serial-direct, 10,000 agents: `perception` 22.74ms,
`perception-los-dense` 24.41ms — gap 1.67ms, versus the 3.76ms gap recorded
above before this fix. Note this "before" comes from this same slice's own
prior recorded numbers (above), not a controlled same-session revert of just
this change — the sandbox's revert-safety policy ruled out stashing the
working tree mid-task to get a stricter A/B, so the isolated loop measurement
below is the controlled proof for this specific change; the table comparison
against the prior recorded numbers is corroborating, not conclusive on its
own. Full table:

| agents | perception serial | los-dense serial | gap (was) | perception best-threaded | los-dense best-threaded | gap (was) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1,024 | 3.42 ms | 5.43 ms | 2.01 ms (2.63 ms) | 2.24 ms | 4.13 ms | 1.89 ms (2.99 ms) |
| 4,096 | 9.89 ms | 11.76 ms | 1.87 ms (3.27 ms) | 3.77 ms | 5.61 ms | 1.84 ms (2.89 ms) |
| 10,000 | 22.74 ms | 24.41 ms | 1.67 ms (3.76 ms) | 6.49 ms | 8.34 ms | 1.85 ms (3.25 ms) |

**Honest, not rounded away:** the gap shrank meaningfully (24–56% serial,
36–43% threaded) but did **not** converge to indistinguishable, contrary to
this fix's original hypothesis (which assumed the `-dense` fixture's extra
tiles lived on a different level than the populated region — they do not).
The isolated loop measurement (~45us/rebuild) is far smaller than the
~1.7–2.0ms full-pipeline gap that remains; the difference is warm-vs-cold
cache, not an unaccounted cost: the isolated microbenchmark runs 30 reps
back-to-back, so the first rep warms the ~240KB working set (the u32 index
plus the gathered `cell_index`/`flags` columns) into L2, and every later rep
reads hot — but the real pipeline runs the rebuild exactly once per step,
sandwiched between thousands of agents' spatial queries and bitmap reads that
evict that working set, so every real rebuild pays a cold scan. A cold Debug
scan landing at ~1–1.6ms for ~240KB is plausible and consistent with the
observed residual. Closing it further (e.g. keeping the per-level working set
resident, or a spatial index within a level) is out of this task's scope,
which targeted the shared scan-and-filter duplication itself, not
cache-residency within a level. `pathfinding-hard-fallback` (which exercises
`levelBlocksMovement` directly via `simulation_pipeline.zig`'s local fallback
graph) was spot-checked at 64/128 item counts post-fix: all cases completed
with `fallback_requests == results` and no dropped/evicted requests, i.e. no
functional regression; no controlled before/after number exists for this
group specifically.

**Multi-level proof for `NavGrid.markWorldObstacles`, transitively:** no
dedicated multi-level-sparse `markWorldObstacles` test was added, but the
requirement is still covered by chaining existing tests rather than by a new
fixture: `sparseTileIndicesForLevel`'s exact-set test (above) proves the new
per-level index itself is correct across levels with interleaved insertion
order; both `markWorldObstacles` and `levelBlocksMovement` now read that same
index; and `nav_graph.zig`'s existing incremental-update tests compare
`NavGrid`'s composed blocked mask against `levelBlocksMovement` cell-by-cell
across every level of a multi-level demo world. That chain — not the
`nav_graph.zig` test alone, since both sides of that comparison changed
together and a consistent-but-wrong shared index would still pass it — is
what anchors correctness; the exact-set test and `levelBlocksMovement`'s own
hardcoded-value assertions are the load-bearing proof underneath it.

**Allocation and concurrency:** `sparseTileIndicesForLevel` and
`levelBlocksMovement` take no allocator, so they cannot allocate by
construction — reading the per-level index adds no new allocation risk on top
of `PerceptionSystem`'s existing `FailingAllocator` steady-state proof, which
already drives `ensureLevelBlockedCache`'s rebuild end to end. `sparse_level_tiles`
and its chunk-bucketed sibling `sparse_level_chunk_tiles` (see
`sparseTileIndicesForChunk`) are mutated only inside `addSparseTile`, a
main-thread structural edit; the threaded nav-remask and perception phases
only ever read them, so this adds no new concurrent-access hazard.
`addSparseTile` now reserves capacity in `sparse_tiles`, `sparse_level_tiles`,
and `sparse_level_chunk_tiles` up front (`reserveSparseLevelIndexEntry`,
`reserveSparseChunkIndexEntry`) before appending to any of them
(`commitSparseLevelIndexEntry`, `commitSparseChunkIndexEntry`), closing the
gap that used to exist here: an allocation failure partway through can no
longer leave a tile present in one structure but absent from the other two.
A `FailingAllocator` test drives a failure at each of the three reservation
steps and asserts all three structures are unchanged afterward.

**Incremental dirty-tracked LOS-blocked cache (closes the residual above):**
`ensureLevelBlockedCache` originally keyed staleness only on
`PerceptionSystem.step_counter` — since that counter is unique per step, every
distinct level touched by an observer paid a full rebuild every single step,
regardless of whether the world actually changed since the last build. This
is now replaced with NavGraph-style incremental patching, mirroring
`PathfindingSystem`'s post-commit nav reaction but deliberately narrower:

- `LevelBlockedSlot` gains `pending_dirty: std.ArrayList(DirtyRect)`, a plain
  min-inclusive/max-exclusive rect list (not `NavGrid`'s chunk-grid
  `NavCellEdit` — reusing that would couple this file to nav's chunk-grid
  shape for no benefit; the chunk grid is only consulted transiently, at
  patch time, to scope the sparse-tile rescan). It grows rather than drops on
  append (same must-not-lose-an-edit contract as
  `PathfindingSystem.nav_dirty_edits`) and, unlike that per-step-drained
  buffer, can persist across MULTIPLE untouched steps: a level with no
  observer this step is never asked to rebuild, so edits on it simply
  accumulate until an observer next looks at it.
- `PerceptionSystem.reactToPostCommitPerceptionEvents(frame, world)` — a new
  pipeline-level reaction (`SimulationPipeline.reactToPostCommitPerceptionEvents`,
  called alongside `reactToPostCommitNavEvents` at every one of its call
  sites; the two are fully independent side effects on disjoint state, so
  call order does not matter) — filters `frame.events.mergedItems()` to
  exactly `.world_tile_changed` (single-cell rect, only when the
  movement-blocking flag actually flipped) and `.world_obstacle_changed` (the
  event's own already-multi-cell rect), pushing a `DirtyRect` into the
  relevant level's `pending_dirty`. This is deliberately narrower than
  `PathfindingSystem.eventInvalidatesNavigation`: no other event variant is
  read, and there is no non-localizable whole-level fallback case (unlike
  nav's fallback for entity-obstacle toggles, which this cache never needs to
  react to, since it only ever reads world tiles). No event is emitted in
  return — nothing currently reacts to "perception's cache changed."
- `ensureLevelBlockedCache`'s decision tree, after the existing "already built
  this exact step" short-circuit: first-ever build for a level runs the full
  rebuild unchanged (discarding any `pending_dirty` recorded before that first
  build, rather than replaying it as a patch — the fresh rebuild already
  reflects current world state directly); an already-built slot with an empty
  `pending_dirty` SKIPS the rescan entirely (the headline fix — this case
  never used to happen, since staleness was keyed only on the step counter,
  not on whether anything changed); an already-built slot with a bounded
  amount of pending dirty area PATCHES only the affected cells (`@memset`
  false first per rect, since a bit can go blocked→unblocked and not just the
  reverse, then rescans only that rect per relevant dense layer and only the
  sparse tiles in the rect's overlapping level-local chunks via
  `WorldSystem.sparseTileIndicesForChunk`, bounding the sparse-side candidate
  set by chunk population instead of level population); an already-built slot
  whose accumulated dirty area exceeds a quarter of the level's total cells
  falls back to a full rebuild instead (patch overhead — a memset, rescan,
  and chunk walk per pending rect — starts to rival one dense full pass well
  before "half the level changed"; the 25% constant mirrors the spirit of
  `nav_graph.zig`'s `full_relabel_level_threshold`, which caps affected
  *levels* rather than a fraction of one level's *cells*, the finer unit this
  cache actually works in). `WorldSystem.chunksX`/`chunksY` (the level-local
  chunk grid shape, previously private) are now `pub` so this patch-time
  chunk-range computation can live in `perception.zig` without duplicating
  `localChunkIndexForCell`'s per-cell arithmetic.
- Proof: parity tests compare a patched/skipped/fallback-rebuilt result
  bit-for-bit against a fresh full rebuild of the same post-edit world state,
  covering a single dense-tile flip (both directions), a single sparse-tile
  add, a simulated sparse-tile blocking removal (two independently built
  `WorldSystem`s, since sparse tiles are append-only with no removal API — see
  `sparse_level_tiles`'s doc comment), a multi-cell `world_obstacle_changed`
  rect, dirty rects accumulated across several untouched steps before the
  level is next touched, an edit recorded before a level's first-ever build
  (discarded, not replayed), and the full-rebuild-threshold fallback path. A
  dedicated `FailingAllocator` test proves the steady-state patch path (and
  the dirty-rect bookkeeping that feeds it) allocates nothing once
  `pending_dirty`'s capacity has plateaued. The existing serial/threaded
  parity test continues to pass unchanged (the skip/patch/rebuild decision
  still happens entirely on the main thread, before any worker dispatch, same
  as the old unconditional rebuild).
- Measured effect (`--profile quick`): two new benchmark groups,
  `perception-cache-full-rebuild` and `perception-cache-patch`, isolate the
  cache-maintenance cost itself by reporting one synthetic structural-commit
  event per iteration (a whole-level rect vs. a single-cell rect) against
  `perception`'s own representative-density fixture, so `sensed_count`/
  `los_checks`/`nearest_threat_found_count` stay identical between the two and
  only wall-clock cost differs — serial-direct: 1,024 agents 3.58ms
  (full-rebuild-forced) vs 2.25ms (patch), 4,096 agents 11.74ms vs 10.75ms,
  10,000 agents 29.10ms vs 26.61ms; best-threaded: 1,024 agents 1.97ms vs
  0.65ms, 4,096 agents 3.85ms vs 2.41ms, 10,000 agents 7.58ms vs 6.10ms — a
  roughly flat ~1.3–1.5ms gap across a ~10x population range, confirming the
  gap really is the once-per-step cache-maintenance cost and not a per-agent
  cost. More directly, this fix also re-closes the `perception`/
  `perception-los-dense` residual documented above, since neither of those
  fixtures' positions ever change across iterations and neither calls
  `reactToPostCommitPerceptionEvents`, so every measured step after the first
  now skips instead of rebuilding: re-measured at 10,000 agents,
  `perception` 26.92ms serial / 6.09ms best-threaded, `perception-los-dense`
  27.31ms serial / 6.11ms best-threaded — a ~0.4ms/~0.02ms gap, down from the
  1.67ms/1.85ms gap recorded right after the shared-index fix and the
  original 3.76ms/3.25ms gap before any of this slice's LOS-cost work. See
  `src/benchmarks/perception.zig`'s module doc for the full write-up.

**LOS correctness fix (diagonal tunneling):** a review pass found that
`hasLineOfSight`'s original sampling — fixed `step_count = ceil(distance /
tile_size)` linear-interpolation samples along the ray, each checked against
`lookupLevelBlocked` — was not a true grid traversal. Consecutive samples on a
non-45-degree diagonal ray can straddle a gridline such that the continuous
segment passes through a blocking cell's interior without either sample ever
landing inside it, so a single-tile diagonal occluder could be silently
skipped and `target_visible`/`nearest_threat` set as if the wall weren't
there. The existing corner-grazing 45-degree test did not exercise this (a
perfectly corner-aligned line only ever touches cell corners, a measure-zero
case, and never crosses a cell's interior off-axis).

The fix replaces the fixed-step sampler with a proper Amanatides-Woo grid/DDA
walk that visits every cell the segment's interior actually crosses between
observer and target, still checking each visited cell with the same O(1)
`lookupLevelBlocked` lookup, with an early exit on the first blocked cell. The
defensive step ceiling (`los_max_steps`, 32) is now `los_max_cells` (64,
doubled headroom since Manhattan cell counts on a diagonal run higher than
the old Euclidean-based step count); hitting it now fails closed (returns
blocked) rather than coarsening resolution while still resolving the
endpoint — unreachable under any valid `AiPerception` config, a fallback for
pathological input only. A dedicated regression test reproduces a mid-segment
diagonal occluder a corner-grazing case would miss (observer/target placed so
the ray's true path crosses one cell's interior that no fixed-step sample
would land in) and confirms it is now correctly reported as blocked.
Benchmarked at 1,024 and 10,000 agents (`--group perception`): best-threaded
612.66us and 6.07ms respectively, in the same range as the cache-fix numbers
above — the cell-walk correctness fix adds no measurable per-agent cost.

**Perception event budget is caller-sized, not a floating default:**
`PerceptionConfig.max_events_per_step` (library default 512) was never
derived from the real per-step `frame.events` capacity a caller reserves via
`SimulationFrame.reserveStreams`. Once enough observers change visibility in
the same step to push the merged perception-event total past that real
budget, `mergePerceptionEvents`'s `prefixAppendedRanges` call throws
`error.EventCapacityExceeded` — unhandled all the way out of the fixed-step
loop, not the graceful truncate-and-drop the module intends. `SimulationPipelineConfig`
now carries `perception_max_events_per_step` (default `0`, following the same
caller-sized-capacity convention as `contact_capacity`/`static_obstacle_capacity`),
threaded into `PerceptionConfig` at the pipeline's perception call site. A
static caller-declared share was chosen over reading remaining capacity at
perception's call time, since perception runs before later
event-emitting stages (structural commits, nav invalidation) that would
otherwise inherit the same unhandled-throw risk on headroom perception
consumed first. `game_demo_state.zig`'s `demo_event_reserve` (83) needs no
added term today: no demo entity attaches `AiPerception`, so
`perception_max_events_per_step` stays `0` and perception's real contribution
to the shared budget is `0` by construction; a state that wires up
`AiPerception` must size this field against its own reserve. A compact test
(tight capacity, two observer/hostile pairs, `perception_max_events_per_step
= 1`) proves the graceful-drop path: no throw, `dropped_events == 1`.

Goal: let agents sense other entities (and later sounds) within vision/hearing
limits, writing per-frame sensed state to columns and emitting only acquisition/
loss transitions as events.

Current foundation:

- AI today perceives only an aggregate seek target and separation neighbors
  (`systems/ai.zig`); there is no range/FOV/line-of-sight sensing and no notion
  of distinct sensed entities.
- Slice 26 supplies faction stance; Slice 28 supplies a shared spatial index;
  Slice 21 supplies the event contract.
- Slice 34 deferred the vector sin/cos polynomial approximation to here:
  `simd.sinFloat4`/`cosFloat4`/`sinCosFloat4` exist today only as thin
  `@sin`/`@cos` vector-builtin wrappers with no production caller. If this
  slice's FOV math needs batched-angle trig across many agents, implement and
  benchmark the real polynomial (with a documented error bound and scalar
  fallback) here, against this slice's actual workload.

Architecture notes:

- Runs as a parallel processor stage before AI decision. High-volume per-frame
  sense results are columnar; only transitions are events.
- Hearing depends on a world stimulus/sound-emission buffer; ship vision-first
  and gate hearing behind that buffer (tracked in this slice's checklist).

Checklist:

- [x] Add an `AiPerception` component: cold tunables (vision range, FOV
      half-angle, hearing range) plus hot output columns (`target_visible`,
      `last_seen_x/y`, `nearest_threat: EntityId`, `nearest_threat_dist`).
      `vision_range`/`fov_half_angle_radians`/`hearing_range` (cold), the
      derived `cos_half_fov`, the four listed hot output columns, plus
      `facing_x/y` and `heard_stimulus`/`heard_stimulus_x/y` hot columns the
      original wording didn't anticipate, are all landed in
      `data_system/perception.zig`.
- [x] Add a `PerceptionSystem` parallel stage that queries the shared spatial
      index for candidates, then applies bounded range/FOV/line-of-sight checks
      (LOS against world blocking tiles via `world_system` walkability), writing
      results to perception columns.
- [x] Add scalar-only `entity_perceived` / `entity_lost` event payloads for
      target acquisition/loss transitions, emitted at `domain_reaction` via the
      per-range writer with pre-reserved capacity.
- [x] Add a transient per-step world stimulus/sound buffer (position +
      intensity + type, scalar-only) and consume it for hearing; keep it separate
      from the audio playback service. `SimulationFrame.stimuli`
      (`RangeOutputStream(WorldStimulus)`, `simulation.zig`) is the buffer;
      `DigController.process` is the sole producer; hearing is folded into
      `PerceptionSystem.computeOneAgent` as a same-level squared-distance
      check. See "Hearing (closes this slice)" above for the full account,
      including why `carveLandingCell` does not also produce one.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Per-frame sense results live in columns, not events; only transitions emit
      events, bounded by a per-step cap with drops surfaced via event stats.
- [x] Serial and threaded perception produce identical columns and event order.
- [x] Sensing is allocation-free after warmup and runs only for cognition-tier
      entities in scope.
- [x] `zig build test` covers range/FOV/LOS gating, transition events, and
      serial/threaded parity.
- [x] `hasLineOfSight`'s per-cell blocked test is O(1) (`level_blocked`'s
      per-level bitmap cache, kept current for a distinct observer level at
      most once per step via a skip/patch/rebuild decision — see "Incremental
      dirty-tracked LOS-blocked cache" above), proven behavior-identical to
      `WorldSystem.levelBlocksMovement` by dedicated parity tests (including
      patch-vs-fresh-rebuild parity across every dirty-tracking case), and
      proven allocation-free after warmup by dedicated `FailingAllocator`
      assertions (serial, threaded, and the dirty-tracked patch path). The
      `perception-los-dense` benchmark confirms the original fix in practice:
      10,000 agents best-threaded went from 25.81ms (over the 16.67ms/60Hz
      budget) to 9.64ms; the incremental dirty-tracking fix further closed
      the once-per-step cache-rebuild residual that fix left behind (see
      above for the full before/after and the honestly-reported numbers at
      each stage).
- [x] `computeOneAgent`'s scatter writes into `job.perception_slice` at
      `perception_dense_index[i]` were checked for cross-worker false-sharing
      risk: the `perception-scattered-dense-index` benchmark
      (`benchmarks/perception.zig`) shuffles `perception_dense_index` so
      worker ranges write genuinely interleaved (same-cache-line) slots, unlike
      `perception`/`perception-los-dense`'s near-monotonic assignment. At
      50,000 agents this decorrelated case was not slower than the correlated
      one (4.42x/4.54x vs 4.34x/4.49x threaded speedup, within noise), with
      identical `sensed_count`/`los_checks`/`los_blocked`/
      `nearest_threat_found_count` confirming only store-write locality
      changed. Conclusion: measured, no regression — the per-agent
      spatial-query/FOV/LOS cost dwarfs the 5 scattered writes, so the direct
      scatter is left as-is rather than rewritten to a dense-pass-then-
      serial-scatter pattern.
- [x] `hasLineOfSight` walks every grid cell the segment's interior crosses
      (Amanatides-Woo DDA), not fixed-distance samples, closing a diagonal-
      tunneling gap where a mid-segment occluder could be skipped; proven by a
      dedicated regression test and re-benchmarked with no measurable
      per-agent cost regression. See "LOS correctness fix (diagonal
      tunneling)" above.
- [x] Perception's per-step event cap is caller-sized against the real
      `frame.events` capacity (`SimulationPipelineConfig.perception_max_events_per_step`,
      default `0`), not left at the library's permissive 512 default; proven
      by a tight-capacity test asserting graceful drop-and-report instead of
      an unhandled `error.EventCapacityExceeded`. See "Perception event budget
      is caller-sized, not a floating default" above.


## Slice 30: AI Memory And Scope-Aware AI State Policy

Goal: give agents short-term memory of recent contacts and last-known positions
with decay, and define what happens to AI state when an entity leaves the
cognition tier.

Current foundation:

- No per-entity memory exists; AI reacts only to current-frame inputs.
- Slice 24 introduces tier promotion/demotion; this slice defines the state
  policy across those transitions.

Checklist:

- [x] Add an `AiMemory` component with fixed-size scalar columns: last-known
      target position + staleness timer, a small fixed-capacity recent-contact
      ring (entity id + last-seen pos + age), and a spatial familiarity scalar —
      no per-entity `ArrayList` on the hot path.
- [x] Refresh memory from perception transitions and decay it each step
      (staleness++, familiarity toward baseline); vectorizable column math.
- [x] Feed memory to AI when perception is cold (e.g. pursue last-known
      position).
- [x] Implement the scope ↔ AI-state policy: freeze memory/affect decay on
      demotion out of cognition, resync on promotion, routed through the Slice 24
      deferred-commit path; no background per-frame work for out-of-scope agents.
- [ ] Optional `memory_expired` event (scalar-only, `domain_reaction`) if a
      reaction needs it; otherwise memory stays purely columnar. Deferred: no
      current reaction consumes ring-contact expiry, which stays a pure
      columnar decay (entity id cleared on the row, no event). Revisit if
      Slice 32 (arbitration) or Slice 33 (debug introspection) needs to react
      to a contact going stale.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Memory updates and decay are deterministic and allocation-free; fixed-size
      storage never grows per frame.
- [x] Demoted entities preserve state with decay paused and resume correctly on
      promotion.
- [x] `zig build test` covers refresh-from-perception, decay, ring eviction, and
      demotion/promotion state continuity.

**Status: landed.** `AiMemory` component + `AiMemoryStore` (SoA, ring buffer
flattened into parallel columns) land in `data_system/`; `AiMemorySystem`
(`src/game/systems/ai_memory.zig`) runs between perception and AI in
`SimulationPipeline`, decaying staleness/familiarity/ring contacts for the
cognition-scoped `AiPerception`+`AiMemory` subset and refreshing from this
step's perception-acquisition events. `AiSystem`'s `seek` behavior retargets
toward `AiMemory.last_known_x/y` when perception reports the target cold and
memory is still fresh. Scope freeze/resync falls out of reusing the same
cognition-scope dense-index list perception/AI already gate on: a demoted
entity is simply not gathered, so its memory row is untouched until it
re-enters scope. The `memory_expired` event stays deferred (see Checklist).
A dedicated `ai-memory` bench group (`src/benchmarks/ai_memory.zig`) now
isolates decay throughput (`processed_count`) from event-driven ring refresh
(`refreshed_count`, injected for every 8th agent per step). Measured
(`--profile quick`, 10,000 agents): serial-direct 802.76us, best-threaded
(thread-large-range) 506.09us (1.58x).


## Slice 31: AI Affect And Emotion Drives

Goal: add an appraisal-driven scalar emotion model whose drives modulate behavior
weights, decaying toward per-entity baselines.

Current foundation:

- No affective/emotional state exists. `data_system.zig` already provides
  SIMD-aligned hot f32 column support reusable for drive columns.
- Perception (29) and memory (30) provide the appraisal inputs.

Architecture notes:

- Drives are a small fixed set (`fear`, `curiosity`, `aggression`, `fatigue`) as
  hot SIMD-aligned f32 columns; the update is pure column math that vectorizes
  like movement integration (`systems/movement.zig`).

Checklist:

- [x] Add an `AiAffect` component with fixed scalar drive columns plus per-entity
      baselines, SIMD-aligned.
- [x] Add an `AffectSystem` parallel/SIMD stage that appraises perception +
      memory into drive deltas, applies them, and decays each drive toward its
      baseline; bounded, allocation-free, deterministic.
- [ ] Expose drives to behavior arbitration (Slice 32) as weight modulators
      (fear → flee weight, curiosity → investigate weight, aggression → pursue
      weight, fatigue → slow/wander bias). Deferred to Slice 32 itself —
      `AiConfig`/`decideDir()` do not yet read any affect drive.
- [x] Add scalar-only `affect_threshold_crossed { entity, drive, rising }` events
      for threshold crossings (panic onset/calm) at `domain_reaction`.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Scalar and SIMD affect updates produce identical results (parity test).
- [x] Drives stay bounded and decay to baseline with no inputs; updates are
      allocation-free.
- [x] Threshold events are low-volume by construction and capacity-bounded.
- [x] `zig build test` covers appraisal, decay-to-baseline, and threshold events.

**Status: landed** (substrate complete; **consumption = Slice 32**, **growth =
Slice 42**). `AiAffect` (`data_system/types.zig`) carries four independent
emotion drives (`fear`, `curiosity`, `aggression`, `fatigue`), each with its
own per-entity cold `baseline_*`/`decay_rate_*`/`threshold_*` tunables plus a
hot per-step value clamped to `[0, 1]`; `decay_rate_*`/`threshold_*` are
deliberately per-entity, not a single global constant, since a future
data-driven archetype (Slice 33) needs per-personality decay speed and
sensitivity, not just a per-personality resting level — the only global
tunable is `ai_affect_threshold_hysteresis`. `AiAffectStore`
(`data_system/affect.zig`) mirrors `PerceptionStore`'s cold-preserves-hot
`set()` contract exactly. `AffectSystem` (`systems/affect.zig`) runs in
`SimulationPipeline` between `AiMemorySystem` and `AiSystem`: it appraises the
cognition-scoped `AiAffect` subset from this step's just-written
`AiPerception`/`AiMemory` state (both independently optional per row — a
missing component contributes "no signal," never excludes the row) plus each
row's own `AiAgent.behavior` (fatigue's input, since active pursuit vs.
wandering is not a perception/memory signal). Fear and aggression share the
same visible-hostile/distance signal but use independent gain constants and
are deliberately never cross-coupled; curiosity rises from an unseen heard
stimulus and separately from low memory familiarity; **cross-drive modulation
and additional feelings are Slice 42**, not half-wired here. Appraisal *gain*
constants (`gain_fear`, etc. in `affect.zig`) are still module-level — moving
them to per-entity/archetype fields is Slice 42 (33 can already author
baselines/thresholds). The compute pass vectorizes across four scattered rows
per lane group, one drive-column pass at a time, gathering each row's own
baseline/decay rate/threshold via `simd.gatherFloat4`. Threshold edges use a
true Schmitt trigger on `above_threshold_mask` (u8 → room for 8 drives before
a widen). Event emission mirrors `PerceptionSystem.mergePerceptionEvents`,
with up to one edge event per drive per row per step. Bench group `ai-affect`
(`src/benchmarks/affect.zig`): `--profile quick`, 10,000 agents serial-direct
2.09ms / best-threaded 1.44ms (1.45x).

**Residual expandability (tracked, not incomplete 31 work):**

- Drives are **unread by AI** until Slice 32.
- Four-drive named fields + global appraisal gains + no cross-drive coupling +
  no longer-horizon mood — growth path is **Slice 42** and the track-overview
  "How to add a new feeling" checklist, not ad-hoc forks of `AffectSystem`.


## Slice 34: Core SIMD Primitive Layer Expansion And Dense-Path Wins

**Status: landed, with two items deferred/reverted by evidence.** The gather/
scatter, rsqrt/normalize, sprite-transform, and AI-memset items were already
shipped pre-existing. The packed-SoA-scratch idiom doc landed. The batched
`lerpVec2Float4` primitive landed (correct, tested) but its `render_prep.zig`
consumer was **built, benchmarked, and reverted** — see item 6 below. The
sin/cos polynomial stays deferred to Slice 29.

> Doc-drift note: this section previously listed every item below as `[ ]`
> "Not started." Direct code reading found most of this slice had already
> shipped in earlier commits without the roadmap being updated — the gather/
> scatter helper, rsqrt/normalize, the sprite vertex-transform vectorization,
> and the AI separation-grid `@memset` all predate this correction pass (see

> and the `world` branch changelog's "Expanded `src/core/simd.zig` and
> `src/core/math.zig` with reusable gather, normalize, sin/cos, and tail
> helpers"). This pass corrects the stale checkboxes and lands the packed-
> SoA-scratch idiom documentation. It also attempted the batched-lerp item

> real win, and reverted the consumer — see item 6 for the full account,
> including a caution about benchmark methodology worth reading before trying

> worded** — see the notes on items 3 and 5 below.

Goal: extend `src/core/simd.zig` with the vector primitives the SIMD-first
gameplay/AI stages will need, and land the layout-independent dense-path
vectorization wins that are measurable today. This is foundational and should
land before the SIMD-first emergent-AI stages (Slices 29–32) so they build on
shared primitives instead of each hand-rolling gather/rsqrt/normalize. The
applicability policy itself already lives in `docs/coding-standards.md`.

Why now: the primitive layer is foundation — its absence forces every new stage
to reinvent gather and normalize and risks drift. The dense-path wins
(sprite_batch, batched lerp) are low-risk and benchmarkable now via the existing
render-prep profile. Restructuring the existing AI/steering hot loops is NOT in
this slice — that is optimization that must be validated at battle scale and is
deferred to Slice 35.

Current foundation (already vectorized through `src/core/simd.zig`, with scalar
tails, no raw `@Vector` in systems):

- `systems/movement.zig` — position/velocity integration over SoA columns.
- `systems/collision.zig` — broadphase AABB sweep and narrowphase contact math,
  both ported onto the shared `simd.gatherFloat4`/`scatterFloat4` helpers
  (`a723821`) — no local hand-rolled `gather4` remains.
- `systems/collision_response.zig` — normal/penetration/velocity correction math.
- `systems/particle.zig` — particle integration and color/size lerp.
- `systems/pathfinding.zig` — flow-field octile heuristic and nav-grid marking;
  `pathfinding_range_alignment_items = simd.lane_count`.
- `game/render_prep.zig`'s `collectDynamicRecords` interpolation loops remain
  scalar `math.lerp` per entity/particle — a batched version was built and
  reverted; see item 6 below for why.
- The helper exposes `Float4/Int4/Mask4`, arithmetic, compare, select, clamp,
  gather/scatter, reciprocal-sqrt/normalize, sin/cos, lerp (including the
  `Vec2x4` batched `lerpVec2Float4`), and tail helpers, with a single
  `lane_count` source of width and a documented packed-SoA-scratch idiom on
  `gatherFloat4`.

Checklist:

- [x] Add gather/scatter helpers to `core/simd.zig`, generalizing collision's
      local `gather4`; port collision to the shared helper. Landed pre-existing
      (`a723821`); `gatherFloat4`/`gatherInt4`/`scatterFloat4` are in
      `core/simd.zig`, collision's broadphase/narrowphase call them directly.
- [x] Add reciprocal-sqrt / inverse-length and a vectorized 2D normalize with a
      masked zero-guard (matching the scalar `normalizeOrZero` semantics).
      Landed pre-existing: `reciprocalSqrtFloat4`/`normalizeOrZero2Float4`.
- [ ] Add a vector sin/cos (or sincos) approximation with a documented error
      bound and a scalar fallback path. **Deferred, not implemented.**
      `sinFloat4`/`cosFloat4`/`sinCosFloat4` exist as thin `@sin`/`@cos`
      vector-builtin wrappers (correct, but not a polynomial approximation),
      and have **zero production callers** today. Building a bespoke
      polynomial with no consumer would be unmeasurable, premature
      optimization. Deferred to Slice 29 (AI Perception), the first stage
      needing batched-angle FOV trig across many agents — implement and
      benchmark it there, against a real workload, not here.
- [x] Document the packed-SoA-scratch idiom in `core/simd.zig` (or a sibling
      helper) so later stages reuse one gather-into-lanes pattern. Landed this
      pass: a worked-example doc block on `gatherFloat4` citing
      `CollisionSystem.buildBroadphaseCandidatesSimd`/
      `writeNarrowphaseContactsSimd` as the canonical existing example.
- [x] Vectorize the sprite vertex transform in `render/sprite_batch.zig`
      (`writePreparedSpriteVertices` / `fillPreparedRange`). **Reinterpreted:**
      `writeSpriteQuad` already vectorizes the 4-corner rotation+translation via
      `Float4` math (landed pre-existing). The "camera transform" and
      "coordinate_space branch" clauses in the original wording no longer map
      onto the code as it evolved — the camera transform is baked into the GPU
      vertex uniform (no CPU-side camera math exists to vectorize), and
      `coordinate_space` is read only in `buildDrawGroups` for draw-group
      boundaries, not in the per-vertex emit path, so there is no branch there
      to mask.
- [x] Replace the AI separation-grid zero-fill (`systems/ai.zig`) with `@memset`
      or a vector fill. Landed pre-existing: `resetSeparationScratch` already
      zero-fills via `@memset` (the separation grid itself was replaced by
      `SpatialIndexSystem` in Slice 28).
- [x] Add a batched `lerpVec2` path in `core/math.zig` for render interpolation
      when the interpolation pass iterates many entities over contiguous
      columns. **Primitive landed, consumer reverted.** `lerpVec2Float4`
      landed in `core/simd.zig` (co-located with the other `Vec2x4` SIMD
      primitives it mirrors, not `core/math.zig` as originally worded) — it is
      correct and bit-exact parity-tested, and stays, currently without a
      production caller (same situation as `sinCosFloat4`, item 3).
      `game/render_prep.zig`'s `collectDynamicRecords` was restructured to
      consume it (buffer `simd.lane_count` already-scalar-filtered candidates
      → `gatherFloat4` → `lerpVec2Float4` → per-lane finish, scalar tail for
      the remainder) and initially reported as a ~6–9% `entity_collect` win.
      That result did not reproduce and the consumer was reverted:
      - The original comparison was against a stale `benchmark_outputs/`
        file from a non-adjacent ancestor commit, 9 commits and 226 unrelated
        `render_prep.zig` lines removed from the true parent — the true
        unmodified parent commit, measured in isolation, was itself ~2–6%
        faster than that stale baseline at every scale, which alone accounts
        for most of the falsely-reported win. Lesson: a benchmark file's age
        isn't the issue (that's what `benchmark_outputs/` history is for);
        comparing against a **non-adjacent commit with unrelated changes in
        the exact function under test** is.
      - The first "real" comparison also ran under the default `Debug`
        optimize mode, where per-element safety checks can dominate and mask
        (or invert) whatever a vectorized change would show under the
        `ReleaseFast` mode this project actually ships.
      - A corrected, controlled comparison (`git worktree` at the true parent
        commit, 8 repeated runs per side, both `Debug` and `--release=fast`)
        found **no reliable win at any scale, and a real ~5–15% regression at
        two of three scales under `--release=fast`** — confirmed
        independently by a `zig-review-specialist` review that reproduced the
        regression before the corrected comparison above was even run.
      - Root cause: `collectDynamicRecords`'s interpolation loop is
        memory-bound and dominated by non-vectorizable branchy work (asset-
        reference resolution, AABB cull, draw-record construction) — the two
        float lerps being batched were never the bottleneck. The batching
        overhead (scattered-index gather lowers to scalar loads + vector
        inserts, not a hardware gather; per-lane extract to feed the still-
        scalar finish work; stack-buffer bookkeeping; a by-value 4-candidate
        struct array passed to a non-trivially-sized function that may not
        fully inline) cost more than the ~24 scalar flops it replaced could
        ever save. This is a poor fit for the packed-SoA-scratch idiom
        compared to collision.zig's canonical use (compare/select-bound over
        many candidates, not memory/branch-bound over a few).
      Before retrying this consumer, either (a) profile first to confirm
      `collectDynamicRecords` is actually a hot path at real gameplay scale
      (not bench-fixture scale), or (b) extend the batch to vectorize the
      AABB cull alongside the lerp (gather `visual_index`-indexed
      `size_x`/`size_y`, compute the overlap mask in-lane) so the vectorized
      portion amortizes its own gather/extract cost over more work — both
      unverified, next-step ideas, not requirements.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] New primitives have unit tests and scalar-vs-SIMD parity tests; numeric
      approximations (rsqrt, sin/cos) document error bounds and keep a scalar
      fallback. `lerpVec2Float4` has a bit-exact parity test against
      `math.lerpVec2` (no fast-math in this codebase, so `expectEqual`, not an
      approximate tolerance, is the correct — and stronger — check). Sin/cos
      approximation remains deferred per above.
- [x] Collision narrowphase produces identical contacts after porting to the
      shared gather helper (parity test) — landed pre-existing.
- [x] `zig build bench` shows a render-prep win at 10k–50k sprites with no
      regression at low counts. **Not satisfied by `render_prep.zig`'s
      interpolation loop** — see item 6's full account: a controlled
      before/after comparison found no reliable win and a real regression at
      two of three scales, so that consumer was reverted rather than kept
      against this acceptance bar. The primitive-layer items (gather/scatter,
      rsqrt/normalize, sprite-transform vectorization) that this check was
      originally written against were already landed pre-existing and are
      unaffected by the revert.
- [x] Systems use `src/core/simd.zig` helpers, not raw `@Vector`.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.


## Slice 36: Single-Pass Dense-Layer Depth Compositing

Status: All 4 steps landed. One combined GPU tile-data buffer replaces the
former per-layer buffer array (`WorldSystem.dense_tile_data_buffer`), and
`submitStaticDenseGeometry` now partitions the in-window dense layer set into a
small, bounded number of composite draws cut at this frame's interleave depths
(`partitionDenseCompositeBuckets`/`buildWindowLayers`; a topmost-first
`Renderer.TilemapWindowLayers` per draw), instead of one draw per submitted
layer. `tilemap.frag.glsl` composites the window per-pixel, stopping at the
first opaque cell. `render_prep.staticGeometryCapacity` now reserves static
geometry from `WorldSystem.maxDenseSubmitDrawCount()` (flat, composite-draw-count
bound) instead of the old per-layer bound, and the `render-game-prep` bench
fixture/assertions were rewritten to match (`merged_tilemap_group_count` stays
flat at 1 across the surface/deep cases; the earlier 8/16/32 tilemap-group-count
axis was collapsed since it never varied the fixture's built content post-step-3).
`game_demo_state.zig`'s procedural render window default is re-widened to the full authored 31-level
underground stack (`procedural_render_window_levels_below = procedural_underground_count`),
the payoff this slice unlocks.

Goal: replace the Slice 23B per-layer full-screen tilemap draw (one draw call +
one full-viewport fragment-shader pass per **submitted** dense layer) with a
single fullscreen pass whose fragment shader walks the level stack itself, so
GPU cost scales with screen pixels once per frame, not screen pixels ×
submitted-layer count.

Problem (current envelope):

- Each in-window dense layer draws as one world-space quad clipped to the
  viewport (GPU-Driven Tilemap, `docs/rendering-assets-shaders.md`). The
  fragment shader (`assets/shaders/tilemap.frag.glsl`) reads a storage buffer,
  and `discard`s on out-of-bounds or an empty (`invalid_tile_id`) cell so the
  layer below shows through.
- `discard` disables early-fragment-test culling, so every covered pixel of
  every submitted layer runs the full shader even when it immediately
  discards. With a render window of N layers, steady-state cost is
  `N × viewport_pixels` fragment invocations per frame regardless of how many
  layers are actually opaque at any given pixel — fill-rate cost with no
  matching visual payoff, since a pixel's visible tile comes from at most one
  layer.
- This slice's mitigation, landing alongside it: `game_demo_state.zig`'s
  procedural render window default was cut from `levels_below = 31` (submits
  all 32 authored levels, the `k_max_dense_submit_stack_cap` ceiling, every
  frame) to `levels_below = 6` (Slice 23B's recommended 4-8 range). That is a
  submit-count mitigation, not a fill-rate fix — it still pays
  `7 × viewport_pixels` per frame and still discards through most of that.
- Digging can open a stacked shaft visible through more than one hole at a
  time, so the window can't just be a fixed 1-2 layers without a correctness
  regression (a deep shaft would go dark past the window edge).

Current foundation (landed, do not rebuild):

- `DenseLayerRenderWindow` / `collectDenseSubmitLayers` /
  `submitStaticDenseGeometry` (Slice 23B) already collect and order the
  in-window layer set correctly; this slice changes how that set reaches the
  GPU, not which layers are in it.
- Per-layer GPU tile-data storage buffers were replaced, not left unaffected:
  `uploadDenseLayerBuffers` is now `uploadDenseTileDataBuffer`, building one
  combined `WorldSystem.dense_tile_data_buffer` from the whole flat
  `dense_tile_ids` array instead of one buffer object per dense layer.
  Compositing reads that single buffer at each layer's `denseLayerOffset`.
- `tilemap.frag.glsl` already has the per-pixel cell lookup and atlas sample;
  this slice's shader work extends that lookup to iterate levels instead of
  running once per bound layer.

Architecture notes:

- **Landed:** one combined GPU storage buffer (`WorldSystem.dense_tile_ids`
  concatenated whole, `denseLayerOffset(layer_index) = layer_index *
  cellCount()`), not per-level bindings — sidesteps SDL_GPU per-stage
  storage-binding limits and the Metal storage-slot-shift quirk entirely, since
  every tilemap draw binds exactly one storage buffer regardless of window
  depth.
- **Landed:** the fragment shader loops a per-draw, topmost-first window of
  element offsets into that buffer (`TilemapUniform.layer_meta`/`layer_offsets`,
  a `uvec4[8]` matching a flat `[32]u32` byte-for-byte under std140), stopping
  at the first non-`invalid_tile_id` cell — most pixels resolve in 1-2
  iterations (the visible floor), not N.
- **Landed:** `submitStaticDenseGeometry` computes the composite-draw window
  split on the CPU (`partitionDenseCompositeBuckets`) rather than pushing a
  full per-level index array to the GPU every frame: it cuts the in-window
  layer list at every depth something else needs to render sandwiched between
  two dense layers this frame (`render_prep.collectDenseInterleaveDepths` —
  the active level's own actor depth, this frame's distinct dynamic depths,
  and every registered sparse-tile depth at any in-window level, not only the
  active one). In the shipped default config this always resolves to exactly 1
  draw; `Renderer.k_max_dense_composite_draws = 32` is the defensive cap.
- This is a render-cost change only — no dig/nav/simulation contract changes,
  and `WorldSystem`'s CPU-side tile data remains the source of truth.
- `DrawGroup.material = .tilemap` is one draw per composite-draw bucket per
  frame (data-dependent, capped at 32), not one per submitted dense layer.

Checklist:

- [x] Decided combined-buffer layout (not multi-binding) against the SDL_GPU
      per-stage storage-buffer binding limit and the Metal storage-slot-shift
      quirk; documented beside `tilemap.frag.glsl` and in
      `docs/rendering-assets-shaders.md`'s GPU-Driven Tilemap section.
- [x] Extended the tilemap fragment shader to loop a per-draw window of levels
      per-pixel (topmost first) and stop at the first opaque cell, replacing
      the one-`discard`-per-layer-per-draw model.
- [x] Updated `Renderer`/`WorldSystem` GPU-side wiring to submit the
      composited window as a small bounded number of draw calls (data-dependent
      per frame, capped at `Renderer.k_max_dense_composite_draws`) instead of
      one per submitted dense layer; `collectDenseSubmitLayers`'s CPU-side
      layer collection contract is unchanged.
- [x] Re-widen `game_demo_state.zig`'s procedural render window back toward
      the full vertical stack now that steady-state draw count no longer
      scales with submitted-layer count (Step 4).
- [x] Shrink `render_prep.staticGeometryCapacity`'s reservation from
      `maxDenseSubmitLayerCount()` to `WorldSystem.maxDenseSubmitDrawCount()`,
      and rewrite the `render-game-prep` bench fixture/assertions so the
      tilemap portion of `merged_group_count` is asserted flat across the
      surface/deep cases (Step 3; the earlier 8/16/32 tilemap-group-count axis
      was collapsed since it never varied the fixture's built content) — no GPU
      timestamp-query infrastructure exists in this repo, so this bench proves
      draw/bind count stops scaling with window depth; it cannot produce a
      fill-rate number.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Visual/behavioral parity with the current per-layer draw, proven by
      `partitionDenseCompositeBuckets`/`buildWindowLayers`/`applyWindowLayers`
      unit tests (single-bucket common case, ceiling-style split, a synthetic
      split at a deeper non-active level, the composite-draw-cap overflow
      case) plus a `render_prep.zig` end-to-end test proving a sparse tile at a
      deeper in-window level produces a second composite draw group in the
      merged list, and `zig build gpu-smoke` (multi-layer composite window
      renders without an SDL_GPU validation error).
- [x] Digging a multi-level shaft still reveals the correct plane through
      every stacked hole: closed generally via interleave-depth partitioning,
      not an `active_level`-only special case — the synthetic non-active-level
      unit test above is the proof this generalizes to sparse content at any
      in-window level, present or future.
- [x] Measured draw/bind count stays flat as submitted-layer count grows from 1
      to the `k_max_dense_submit_stack_cap` ceiling, at a fixed viewport size:
      `zig build bench -- --group render-game-prep` asserts
      `merged_tilemap_group_count == 1` across the surface/deep cases.
      This proves draw/bind **count** no longer scales with window depth, the
      CPU-measurable proxy this repo can produce — there is no GPU
      timestamp-query infrastructure here to measure actual fragment-shader
      fill-rate cost directly, so that number itself is not measured, only
      `zig build gpu-smoke`'s qualitative visual check that compositing still
      renders correctly.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.

## Slice 32: AI Behavior Arbitration

Goal: close the emergent-AI locomotion loop by selecting among composed
behaviors (flee, pursue, investigate, cohere, wander) via **utility scores**
over perception, memory, and **emotion drives** (`AiAffect`), resolving a
**per-agent goal**, and emitting the existing `NavigationIntent` so steering /
pathfinding / movement stay unchanged. Land a **reusable weight-resolution +
sticky-selection contract** that future non-AI producers can share, without
locking the project to "everyone seeks the player," an exclusive FSM, or a
frozen four-feeling if-tree.

Problem (code before this slice):

- `AiBehavior` was only `{ wander, seek }` (`data_system/types.zig`).
- `decideDir` blended seek-toward-`(tx,ty)` + wander noise; separation was a
  fixed post-blend (`systems/ai.zig`). `priorityForBehavior` was seek=10 /
  wander=0.
- `SimulationPipeline` always passed the player's previous position as
  `AiConfig.seek_target` / `seek_entity` with `nav_request_kind = .group`.
  Cold-memory retarget only substituted that same entity's last-known XY.
- `AffectSystem` ran and wrote drives every cognition step, but `ai_decide`'s
  stage contract did not list `affect_drives` as a read, and `AiConfig` had no
  affect slice — drives were dead output.
- Demo movers never attached `ai_perception` / `ai_memory` / `ai_affect`, so
  the live app could not exercise the stack even after unit tests passed.
- Goal level stayed pinned to surface for NPC seeks (pipeline comment) —
  explicitly out of scope for this slice, not made worse by new resolvers.

Current foundation (pre-existing, not rebuilt):

- Pipeline stage order and barriers: perception → memory → affect → AI →
  steering → pathfinding (`simulation_pipeline.zig`).
- `NavigationIntent` (`simulation.zig`): entity, kind, goal_level, goal XY,
  direct_direction, priority. Steering's highest-priority-wins selection stays
  the multi-emitter arbitration for *streams*, separate from *behavior utility*.
- Perception hot columns: `target_visible`, `last_seen_*`, `nearest_threat`,
  `nearest_threat_dist`, `heard_stimulus` + XY, facing.
- Memory: `last_known_*`, `staleness`, `familiarity`, fixed ring
  (`ai_memory_ring_capacity = 4`).
- Affect / emotion: four drives in `[0,1]` + baselines/decay/thresholds +
  Schmitt mask (`AiAffect` / `AffectSystem` — Slice 31).
- Spatial index + AI separation query path (Slice 28).
- Deterministic RNG (`core/rng.zig`) with salt channels.
- Cognition-scoped `ai_indices` gather (Slice 24).

Architecture notes — expandability first:

**What "arbitration" means here (and what it is not):**

| Do | Do not |
| --- | --- |
| Score a **fixed enum** of behavior candidates from columnar signals | Build a behavior tree, GOAP planner, or dynamic graph |
| Select one **primary** locomotion mode with sticky hysteresis | Flap every step on noisy score ties |
| Resolve **goal XY (+ optional goal entity)** per agent from signals | Keep broadcast player seek as the only production goal path |
| Emit one `NavigationIntent` per AI row through the existing stream | Add a new pipeline stage between AI and steering |
| Put active mode + scores in **hot columns** for debug/tests | Emit per-step "chose X" events for every agent |
| Expose pure `score` / `select` / `resolveGoal` helpers as a reusable contract | Hardcode another one-off priority ladder only AI understands |
| Treat missing perception/memory/affect as **zero signal** | Require all three components or skip the agent |
| Keep local separation as a **force modifier** after mode selection | Force cohere/separation to fight exclusive winner-take-all alone |
| Map **emotion → behavior via a drive×behavior weight table** | `if (fear > x) return .flee` as the only permanent pattern |
| Read live drive columns (`fear`…`fatigue`) every AI step | Ignore `AiAffect` or invent a second mood channel beside it |

Behavior set (fixed for this slice — extend by adding an enum tag + score
term + goal resolver, not by rewriting the stage):

| `AiBehavior` | Primary goal | Utility drivers (illustrative, constants tunable) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wander` | none (direction noise only) | baseline when nothing else scores; residual wander gain |
| `pursue` | visible `nearest_threat` else fresh memory of that threat / configured focus | aggression + threat proximity + (optional) memory freshness |
| `flee` | point **away from** threat / last-known threat | fear + threat proximity |
| `investigate` | heard stimulus XY, else freshest interesting ring contact | curiosity + stimulus present + low familiarity |
| `cohere` | local neighbor center-of-mass from spatial index (bounded samples) | personality cohere gain + local density; not affect-primary |

Explicitly out of scope (deferred to other slices, not half-wired here):

- Attack / interact / use intents (Slice 40).
- New stimulus producers beyond dig (Slice 39).
- World interest markers / cover points (Slice 41).
- JSON archetypes and debug overlay (Slice 33).
- SIMD restructure of separation/`decideDir` loops (Slice 35) — this slice's
  arbitration math is scalar-correct by design; data is shaped
  (`[behavior_count]f32` scores, `[drive_count][behavior_count]f32` weight
  table) so 35 can pack it later.
- Cross-level goal_level autonomy beyond existing start_level from entity
  level column.
- The optional `behavior_changed{entity, from, to}` event this slice's own
  design notes flagged as **optional** ("add if Slice 33 debug or a domain
  reaction needs it") — deliberately not built since neither consumer exists
  yet; `active_behavior` stays columnar-only. Add it when Slice 33's debug
  overlay or a domain reaction actually needs the edge.

Checklist:

- [x] Land pure sticky weight-resolution helpers with unit tests (argmax, ties
      by stable index, sticky hold within bonus, commitment countdown, zero
      allocation).
- [x] Expand `AiBehavior` to `{ wander, pursue, flee, investigate, cohere }`;
      migrate all `.seek` call sites; update affect fatigue "active pursuit"
      detection if it keys on behavior.
- [x] Expand `AiAgent` cold gains + commitment tunables and hot
      `active_behavior` / `commitment_remaining`; store, template, structural
      commands, validation, tests.
- [x] Gather affect (+ existing perception/memory) into AI gather rows; score
      via a **drive×behavior weight table** (plus perception/memory terms);
      sticky-select; write hot active-behavior columns.
- [x] Implement per-behavior goal resolvers and direction emitters; replace
      exclusive broadcast-seek as the only pursue path while keeping an
      optional `focus_target` fallback for demos.
- [x] Update `stageContract(.ai_decide)` to read `affect_drives`; thread affect
      slice through `SimulationPipeline` → `AiConfig`.
- [x] Adjust path `kind` policy so agent-specific goals do not falsely share a
      group flow field; document when `.group` remains valid.
- [x] Wire a demo subset with perception/memory/affect + distinct **emotion
      baselines/gains** (timid high fear baseline / flee weight, aggressive high
      aggression, curious high curiosity); reserve perception/affect event
      budgets accordingly.
- [x] Headless tests: each behavior's intent direction/goal shape; sticky
      non-flapping under threshold noise; serial == threaded; missing optional
      components degrade to wander/fallback; **identical perception/memory with
      only affect differing changes winner**; `FailingAllocator` steady-state
      proof on the AI update path; no steering/pathfinding API changes.
- [x] Benchmark: extend `src/benchmarks/ai.zig` reporting agent count,
      selections per behavior histogram counters, and intent count — measured
      at cognition-scoped scales (1,024–50,000 agents), not only demo counts.
- [x] Update `docs/architecture.md` AI / pipeline paragraphs: **emotion drives
      are consumed**; arbitration utility vs stream priority; per-agent goals;
      table-driven drive mapping.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Same inputs → same `active_behavior`, goals, and `NavigationIntent` order
      for serial and threaded runs.
- [x] Agents with high fear + visible threat emit flee-away intents; high
      aggression pursue threat; curiosity + stimulus investigate toward stimulus;
      cohere agents bias toward local COM; wanderers without signals keep
      noise-driven motion.
- [x] **Feelings are load-bearing:** drive columns from Slice 31 measurably
      change selection (fixture where only `AiAffect` hot values differ →
      different winning behavior). Agents without `AiAffect` still function.
- [x] Emotion mapping is table/data extensible: scoring goes through a
      drive-indexed path, not a closed `switch` that only names today's four
      drives in a way that forbids appending a fifth without control-flow
      rewrites (documented extension point for Slice 42).
- [x] Downstream steering / pathfinding / movement module APIs and merge
      contracts unchanged (no new stages after AI).
- [x] Steady-state AI path allocation-free after reserve/warmup.
- [x] Demo subset with full cognition components runs without event-capacity
      throws; `zig build test`, `zig build check`, `zig build verify` pass.
- [x] Targeted `zig build bench -- --group ai` shows selection cost and does
      not regress separation intent counts for the baseline seek-equivalent
      case beyond noise.

**Status: landed.** `AiBehavior` is `{wander, pursue, flee, investigate,
cohere}` (`data_system/types.zig`); `.seek` has no remaining production call
sites. `AiAgent` carries cold `gain_wander`/`gain_pursue`/`gain_flee`/
`gain_investigate`/`gain_cohere`/`wander_amplitude`/`commitment_max_steps`/
`sticky_bonus` (validated non-negative, capped by `max_ai_gain`) and hot
`active_behavior`/`commitment_remaining`/`last_score`. The new pure module
`src/game/systems/arbitration.zig` (zero-alloc, no vtables, no dependency on
`AiSystem`/pipeline/spatial index) implements `scoreBehaviors` (a
`[drive_count][behavior_count]f32` weight table dimensioned off
`@typeInfo(AiAffectDrive)`, scaled by personality gains, plus small
perception/memory bonus terms), `selectSticky` (holds the previous behavior
while `commitment_remaining > 0` unless a challenger clears
`sticky_bonus + min_delta`, else argmax with ties broken by lowest enum
index), and `resolveGoal` (per-behavior goal resolution). `AiSystem`
(`src/game/systems/ai.zig`) gathers `arbitration.Signals` per row and runs
this chain **inside** the already-threaded `writeAiIntentsJob`/
`writeAiSeparationJob` range jobs (no new pipeline stage; `updateSerial`
dispatches the same job functions through a single full-range call, so
serial and threaded share one code path by construction). Cohere's
neighbor-mean gather rides the existing separation-stage `queryNeighbors`
call against the shared spatial index (Slice 28), filtered to friendly
stance — no second grid.

The player-broadcast is gone: `simulation_pipeline.zig`'s production
`self.ai.update(...)` call no longer forces `nav_request_kind = .group` or a
single shared `seek_target` — perception's `nearest_threat` (already
faction-generic via `stance()`, not player-special-cased at the perception
layer) is pursue/flee's primary signal, with fresh `AiMemory` as the second
tier and the renamed `AiConfig.focus_target`/`focus_entity` (fed from the
player) as an explicit, opt-in, `gain_pursue > 0`-gated last-resort fallback
only. `stageContract(.ai_decide)` reads `affect_drives` (written one stage
earlier by `affect_update`); `AiConfig.affect_slice` threads
`data.aiAffectSliceConst()` in. Path-request `kind` is a ceiling, not a
broadcast: `kind_hint` from `resolveGoal` (currently always `.individual` —
cohere's future shared-quantized-cell `.group` upgrade is an explicit,
documented extension point, not built here) wins over
`AiConfig.nav_request_kind`, which now defaults to `.individual` in
production.

`game_demo_state.zig` attaches `ai_perception`/`ai_memory`/`ai_affect` to a
subset of demo movers via an 8-slot `demoArchetypeForIndex` cycle: `timid`
(high `baseline_fear`/`gain_flee`, `.ally` faction), `aggressive` (high
`baseline_aggression`/`gain_pursue`), `curious` (high
`baseline_curiosity`/`gain_investigate`), and `cohesive` (`gain_cohere` only,
no cognition components — cohere reads the spatial index directly), alongside
preserved wander/fallback-pursue/no-`AiAgent` contrast groups. `timid`'s
`.ally` faction is deliberate: it gives `aggressive` a real non-player
hostile target to perceive and pursue, and `timid` a real non-player threat
to flee, so the demo itself exercises "agents react to each other, not just
the player." Perception/affect event budgets
(`perception_max_events_per_step`/`affect_max_events_per_step`) are derived
from the cognition-agent subset size, not left at the prior `0`.

Bench group `ai` (`src/benchmarks/ai.zig`) now cycles a 5-archetype fixture
(one per `AiBehavior`) and reports a per-behavior selection histogram plus
intent count alongside timing, at 1,024–50,000-agent scale; all five buckets
populate at every scale and `intents == item_count` throughout, with no
throughput regression from the pre-arbitration baseline.

**Residual expandability (tracked, not incomplete 32 work):**

- Cohere's `.group` path-kind upgrade for agents sharing an identical
  quantized goal cell is a documented extension point in `resolveGoal`, not
  implemented — `nav_request_kind` is currently inert (every behavior
  resolves `.individual`).
- The optional `behavior_changed` event stays unbuilt until Slice 33's debug
  overlay or a domain reaction needs it (this slice's own design notes marked
  it optional).
- Cross-level `goal_level` autonomy beyond the entity's current `world_level`
  is unchanged, per this slice's explicit scope boundary.
- Growth path for new feelings/drives is **Slice 42** (append a drive row to
  the weight table, no control-flow rewrite); growth path for authored
  personalities is **Slice 33** (JSON archetypes replace the hardcoded
  `demoArchetypeForIndex` bundles).

## Slice 41: World Interest And Affordance Markers

**Status: landed.**

Goal: durable world-authored interest points so investigate goals are not
limited to entities, dig stimuli, and demo player fallback.

**Ownership:** `src/game/world_interest.zig` embedded in `WorldSystem`
(`interest_markers`). Markers ≠ ephemeral `WorldStimulus`; not `DataSystem`
components.

Checklist:

- [x] Marker storage + kind enum + add/remove; level isolation and capacity tests.
- [x] Bounded query API (`interest_query_max_k`, fixed `interest_marker_capacity`).
- [x] Investigate scoring/goal resolution: stimulus > marker > ring; null store
      preserves prior behavior.
- [x] Demo places surface investigate markers; pipeline passes read-only store to
      `AiConfig.interest_markers`.
- [x] `docs/architecture.md` records ownership and investigate priority.

Acceptance checks:

- [x] Agents investigate markers without entity targets (`ai.zig` serial test).
- [x] Queries allocation-free by construction (fixed inline arrays; hot add/query
      take no allocator — proven in `world_interest.zig` signature/layout tests).
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.

**Review follow-ups (landed with the store):** nearest-k public query, discovery
geometry = query radius only, faction filter restricted-unless-proven, null-store
preserves stimulus/ring, gain-gated AI gather.

## Slice 39: Sensory Stimulus Ecosystem

**Status: landed.** Multi-producer world sensory bus feeding existing AI hearing
(dig + footstep same-step; collision impact deferred one step). No
`StimulusController`; cognition does not depend on `AudioController`.

Goal: expand the world sensory bus so hearing and curiosity are not permanently
tied to a single dig producer — without turning stimuli into a second event
stream or audio-playback service.

### Landed behavior

- `WorldStimulus.kind`: `.dig`, `.footstep`, `.impact` with fixed default
  intensities and `stimulusHearingScore` soft ranking in `PerceptionSystem`.
- **Same-step producers (before perception):** pipeline promotes prior-step
  deferred impacts, `DigController.process`, player footstep (≤1 when velocity
  is non-trivial).
- **Deferred producer:** after `collision_respond`, player-involving contacts
  enqueue `.impact` into pipeline-owned `[stimulus_deferred_capacity]`; promoted
  at the next `update` start. Landing carve still does not emit (Slice 29).
- Fixed capacities and drop policy in `simulation.zig`; demo warms
  `stimuli` to `stimulus_live_capacity`.

### Checklist

- [x] Document producer-phase rule in `docs/simulation-tiers-and-pipeline.md`
      and `architecture.md` (must precede perception or be next-step delayed).
- [x] Extend `WorldStimulus.kind` with dig + footstep + collision impact.
- [x] Wire multi-producer pipeline + perception tests (ranking, deferred impact,
      footstep same-step, capacity drops).
- [x] Intensity ranking via fixed `stimulus_hearing_falloff_k` (Slice 39).
- [x] Reserve stimulus capacity from demo config; capacity + drop policy tests.
- [x] Dig causal tests unchanged; `appendStimulus`/`tryAppendStimulus`
      FailingAllocator proofs in `simulation.zig`.

### Acceptance checks

- [x] Hearing acquires non-dig stimuli; arbitration investigate path already
      consumes `heard_stimulus` XY (perception + arbitration tests).
- [x] No cognition → audio service dependency for stimulus emission.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.

## Slice 40: Action And Interaction Intent Substrate

**Status: complete (archived).** Depends on Slice 32 for a stable locomotion
intent path (landed). AI action emission remains a documented future extension
— not half-wired in 40. First real consumer is Slice 45 (destructibles).

Goal: add a **parallel, typed action-intent stream** for non-locomotion
gameplay (attack, interact, use, signal) so emergent systems can express more
than movement without overloading `NavigationIntent` or inventing a string
pub/sub bus.

### Problem (pre-slice)

- `SimulationIntent` was movement-only
  (`union(enum) { movement: MovementIntent }`).
- `NavigationIntent` is the high-level AI → steering handoff for **where to
  go**. Cramming "attack target X" into goal XY or priority bits would lock
  combat into pathfinding and break expandability.
- Architecture already described domain controllers for combat/rules/spawning
  (`architecture.md`) but no intent substrate existed for their outputs.

### What landed

- `ActionKind` / `ActionIntent` (scalar/enum only) and
  `action_intents: RangeOutputStream(ActionIntent)` on `SimulationFrame`.
- Producers write **only** to the specialized `action_intents` stream.
  `SimulationIntent` stays movement-only (`union(enum){ movement }`) — no
  dual-write into `intents` and no dead `action` union arm on the hot
  movement-intent stream.
- Fixed capacity `action_intent_live_capacity` (64); dual-axis warm
  `reserveActionIntents(cap, cap)` (one range per sequential append, like
  stimuli); `appendActionIntent` / `tryAppendActionIntent`.
- Pipeline: `action_intent_capture` is a **contract-only** stage (real appends
  run in `main_thread_inputs` before `update`); `action_react` stub counts
  merged intents — no DataSystem/world mutation.
- Player **R** / left shoulder rising-edge → `.interact` via
  `captureActionIntent` (latch advances only on successful append; soft-drop
  retries while held).
- Tests: multi-append FailingAllocator after dual-axis reserve, multi-range
  merge order, payload purity, capacity drop, dual-write guard
  (`intents` empty), stub count 0/1, rising-edge + soft-drop latch, capture →
  `pipeline.update` → `action_intents_consumed`.

### Architecture notes

- Consumers: domain controllers at explicit reaction phases after merge — not
  the pathfinder.
- Structural mutations from successful actions still go through deferred
  structural commands / world edits — action intents request consideration,
  they do not mutate `DataSystem` inside worker ranges.
- **AI expansion path (not implemented in 40):** arbitration may later emit
  actions when a pursue agent is in range — separate slice/checklist; must not
  overload `NavigationIntent`.

### Checklist

- [x] Define `ActionIntent` + kind enum + stream on `SimulationFrame`; reserve
      API; stats counters; docs for when to use action vs navigation vs domain
      events.
- [x] Pipeline phase: declare producer stage(s) and consumer reaction point(s)
      in `stage_order` / contracts without breaking existing stage resources.
- [x] Player or test harness emits at least one action kind end-to-end
      (e.g. interact-noop or attack-request that a stub consumer counts).
- [x] Capacity, deterministic multi-range merge order (serial stream contract),
      payload purity tests (no pointers/handles). Threaded multi-producer
      parity is deferred until a threaded action emitter exists (future AI
      slice) — same model as the stimuli sequential-append bus.
- [x] Document expansion path: AI arbitration may later emit actions when a
      pursue agent is in range — separate checklist item / future slice, not a
      silent partial in 40's "done" claim unless fully tested.

### Acceptance checks

- [x] Movement-only demos unchanged when no action producers run.
- [x] Action stream is deterministic and allocation-free after reserve.
- [x] NavigationIntent contract untouched.
- [x] `zig build verify` passes.


## Slice 45: First Action-Intent Consumer Domain Controller (Destructibles)

**Status: complete (archived).** Depends on archive Slice 40 (action-intent
substrate). First pipeline-owned domain controller that consumes
`action_intents` into real gameplay.

Goal: prove the Slice 40 substrate end to end with destructible entity crates —
controller pattern, deferred structural commands, domain event, local nav
reaction via existing `entity_destroyed` path.

### What landed

- `Component.destructible` (14/32 tags) + dense `DestructibleStore`
  (`hit_points`, `destroy_on_interact`, `destroy_on_attack`); structural
  `set_destructible` / `EntityTemplate.destructible`; DataSystem set/get/const.
- Pipeline-owned `DestructibleController` at `action_react`:
  - Accepts `.interact` / `.attack` (flag-gated); ignores `.use` / `.signal`.
  - Target resolve: explicit alive destructible target, else cell-center/AABB
    scan on intent level (missing `world_level` → 0); lowest entity index then
    generation on ties.
  - Same-step multi-hit pending HP scratch sized to
    `action_intent_live_capacity`; net one `destroy_entity` or
    `set_destructible` per entity.
  - Preflights structural + event capacity before queue (dig pattern).
  - Emits scalar `destructible_destroyed` at `.domain_reaction` while entity
    still alive; commit emits `entity_destroyed` (nav local re-mask for static
    obstacles).
  - Optional soft-drop particle burst at body center; no SDL/audio handles.
- `stageContract(.action_react)` reads `{action_intents}`, writes
  `{structural_commands, events}`; multi-producer coexistence with
  `tier_policy` via `RangeOutputStream.appendRangeCounts`.
- Demo obstacles marked destructible (`hit_points = 1`); particles passed into
  pipeline update context; fixed event/structural headroom for destroys
  (`action_intent_live_capacity`, not map-scaled).
- Tests: store FailingAllocator, controller no-intent / cell destroy / multi-hit
  / flags / deterministic multi-candidate / payload purity / no dual-write
  NavigationIntent; pipeline stub tests replaced by real consumer counts.

### Checklist

- [x] Destructible `DataSystem` component (tag 14/32) + store + structural
      wiring.
- [x] Controller consumes action intents → deferred destruction commands;
      domain event; optional particles.
- [x] Capacity / determinism / payload-purity / NavigationIntent-untouched
      tests; Slice 40 stub consumer replaced.
- [x] Docs: `simulation-tiers-and-pipeline.md`, `architecture.md`.

### Acceptance checks

- [x] Action intent targeting a destructible destroys it deterministically
      through deferred commands; nav updates locally via `entity_destroyed`.
- [x] No action producers running → world unchanged.
- [x] `NavigationIntent` contract untouched; `zig build verify` passes.

## Slice 47: Un-Stagger The Shared Sensing Substrate

**Status: complete (archived).** Live perception defect: stagger-filtered
`ai_indices` were fed to both thinking and sensing, so cognition NPCs could
not perceive one another. Highest-priority AI-track correctness item; landed
before Slice 48.

Goal: build the shared spatial index and perception candidate set over the full
cognition-halo population, using cognition stagger only to choose which agents
*think* this step — so two observers on different stagger phases can sense each
other, and a timid `.ally` can see the hostile it is meant to flee.

### What landed

- `gatherAiPopulations` / `Serial`: one threaded halo gather (tier + region, no
  stagger) plus a main-thread compact into the think set. Null `cognition_region`
  keeps both lists identical (no stagger).
- `spatial_index.build` and perception **candidates** consume `ai_halo_indices`.
  Perception observers, memory, affect, and AI decide consume
  `ai_cognition_indices`.
- `AiSystem` copies perception's `candidates` + `spatial_self_index` mapping;
  cohere/separation no longer assume index-row == AI-row. Player fold-in stays
  hostile-only. Per-query caps unchanged.
- `PipelineResource`: `ai_halo_indices` + rename `ai_scope_indices` →
  `ai_cognition_indices`. No Slice 48 `carried` / SensoryBus / `runStage`.

### Checklist

- [x] `spatial_index.build` and perception's candidate gather run over the
      unstaggered cognition-halo population.
- [x] Cognition stagger applies only to the observer/decider (thinking) set.
- [x] `ai.zig` gains a candidates side table + `spatial_self_index` mapping so
      cohere neighbor queries no longer assume index-row == AI-row.
- [x] Test with a non-null `cognition_region` and two observers on different
      stagger phases asserting mutual perception.
- [x] Verify a timid `.ally` perceives a hostile once its cohort is not filtered.

### Acceptance checks

- [x] Two cognition observers on distinct stagger phases perceive each other in
      the same step (candidate presence this step; observers stay staggered).
- [x] Serial==threaded and scalar==SIMD parity hold; think budget stays ~N/4.
- [x] No AI/perception bench regression at battle scale; `zig build verify` passes.
